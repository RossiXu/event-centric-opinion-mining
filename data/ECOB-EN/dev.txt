Japan's military seeks record spending to counter North Korea, China moves
Japan’s defense ministry on Wednesday asked for a hike in spending to record levels, as it juggles its responses to a growing ballistic missile threat from North Korea and China’s assertive moves in the East China Sea.	O	O
If approved, the hike of 2.3 percent will take the defense budget to 5.17 trillion yen ($51.47 billion) in the year starting April 1, for a fifth consecutive increase as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe bolsters Japan’s military.	O	O
The nation’s Self Defense Forces are pivoting away from guarding the north against a diminished Russian threat to reinforce an island chain stretching 1,400 km (870 miles) along the southern edge of the East China Sea.	O	O
That means opting for fewer tank divisions as they build a mobile amphibious force from scratch.	O	O
The costly rejig comes as Japan is also forced to spend more to guard against ballistic missiles being developed by North Korea capable of striking most areas.	O	O
PATRIOT UPGRADE The single biggest expenditure is 99 billion yen ($970 million) to upgrade Japan’s warhead-killing Patriot batteries, a last line of defense against missile strikes.	O	O
The improvements will double their range to around 30 km (19 miles) and sharpen targeting to hit arriving ballistic warheads.	O	O
They will take five years to complete, with the first four enhanced Patriots expected to be ready for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.	O	O
In June, North Korea test-fired what appeared to be two mobile Musudan rockets, one of which climbed to 1,000 km (600 miles), or enough to fly more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles) down range.	O	O
On Aug. 24, Pyongyang also fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) toward Japan that traveled 500 km (311 miles).	O	O

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonJapan’s biggest defense contractor, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) (7011.T) will upgrade the PAC-3s under license from Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co, sources familiar with the plan told Reuters last month.	O	O
The budget request also includes funding to improve Aegis destroyers that are Japan’s first line of defense against ballistic missiles.	O	O
Japan and the United States are developing a new warhead killer, the Standard Missile 3 (SM-3), to destroy targets in space, but no decision on a full rollout has yet been made.	O	O
SOUTHWEST SHIFT Other proposed defense buys will reinforce the East China Sea, where Japan and China are locked in a territorial dispute over a group of islets 220 km (140 miles) northeast of Taiwan known as the Senkakus in Tokyo and the Diaoyus in Beijing.	O	O
Japanese air scrambles against Chinese aircraft are running at a record high, with Beijing’s navy probing deeper and more frequently into the Western Pacific beyond Japan’s island chain.	O	O
Chinese military activity in the region was “escalating,” Japan’s Self-Defence Forces chief Admiral Katsutoshi Kawano said in June.	O	O
Defence officials want 95 billion yen next year to buy six Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighters, and a combined 92 billion for four Boeing Co (BA.N) and Bell Helicopter (TXT.N) V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and six Boeing Chinook twin-rotor helicopters.	O	O
The SDF also wants 11 BAE Systems (BAES.L) AAV7 amphibious assault craft, and two long-range Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012.T) C-2 military cargo jets.	O	O
Other buys will include a Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) unmanned Global Hawk surveillance drone and a new larger-class diesel-electric submarine designed by Mitsubishi Heavy and Kawasaki Heavy.	O	O

Japan defence ministry seeks record budget to counter Chinese threat
Japan’s defence ministry has requested a record budget to counter growing Chinese military activity around a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea.	O	O
The ministry is seeking 5.17 trillion yen (£38bn) for the year beginning in April 2017.	O	O
That marks an increase of 2.3% from last year, and is the fifth annual increase since Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, came to power in late 2012 vowing to bolster the military to address a surge in Chinese naval activity and North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.	O	O
The latest budget request marks a continuation in the shift in focus away from Japan’s northern maritime border with Russia – where cold war Soviet forces once posed a threat – to an 870-mile chain of southern outlying islands stretching from the Japanese mainland towards Taiwan.	B	Japan defence ministry seeks record budget
Much of the hardware on the defence ministry’s shopping list is designed to counter potential threats to Japanese territory in the East China Sea, including the disputed Senkaku islands, which are also claimed by Beijing.	I	Japan defence ministry seeks record budget
At the heart of the strategy is the development of a mobile amphibious force – modelled on the US marine corps – that would be able to respond quickly to an attempt to invade the Senkakus, which China refers to as Diaoyu.	O	O
In the single biggest outlay, the ministry wants more than 100bn yen to upgrade Japan’s Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missiles, seen as the last line of defence against a nuclear or conventional attack by North Korea.	O	O
The sense of urgency in Tokyo over missile defence is growing amid evidence that North Korea is making progress in its attempts to build reliable ballistic missiles capable of reaching Japan, including those launched from submarines.	O	O
The improvements will dramatically enhance the PAC-3’s range and its ability to target incoming missiles.	O	O
The Senkakus are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially huge oil and gas deposits.	O	O
The uninhabited islets are administered by Japan, but Chinese vessels have stepped up incursions into waters near the territories in recent months.	O	O

Photograph: Aflo/Barcroft To improve Japan’s ability to patrol the islands, ministry officials want to spend 95bn yen on six Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighters, as well as more than 90bn yen on four Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and six Boeing Chinook twin-rotor helicopters.	O	O
Incursions by Chinese planes into Japanese airspace near the Senkakus were met with a record number of scrambles by Japanese fighter planes between April and June, while Tokyo continued to resist Beijing’s requests for talks on the dispute.	O	O
This month, the Japanese foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, summoned China’s ambassador in Tokyo, Cheng Yonghua, to protest against Chinese maritime activity in the area, saying it had contributed to a “marked deterioration” in Sino-Japanese ties.	O	O
Last week, however, Kishida and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, agreed it was important to establish lines of communication to avoid accidents near the Senkakus that could quickly escalate into a conflict.	O	O
“We reached a common recognition that we have to control friction at sea firmly through the efforts of both countries,” Wang told reporters during a trilateral summit in Tokyo that also included South Korea’s foreign minister.	O	O
As a prominent member of a group of conservative politicians who believe the postwar constraints imposed on Japan’s military are unfair and out of date, Abe wants the country’s self-defence forces to play a bigger international role that includes possible involvement in overseas conflicts.	O	O
Last summer, his governing coalition pushed through controversial security legislation that reinterpreted Japan’s war-renouncing constitution to allow the armed forces to exercise its right to collective self-defence – or coming to the aid of an ally – for the first time since the end of the second world war.	O	O
Despite the broader scope afforded Japanese troops by the new laws, speculation is mounting that Abe, whose coalition dominates both houses of parliament, will attempt to ditch article 9 of the US-authored constitution, which restricts Japan’s military to a purely defensive role.	O	O

Japan is poised to hike its defense spending again, breaking the record for the fifth year in a row.	O	O
The money would boost Tokyo’s ability to oppose Beijing in the South China Sea and protect itself from a possible missile attack by North Korea.	B	record budget
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet will require 5.17 trillion yen (US$50 billion) from parliament, the Japanese Defense Ministry announced Wednesday.	O	O
If approved, it would translate into a 2.3 percent boost in the country’s defense spending.	O	O
The Finance Ministry is yet to check the request before it is potentially sent to legislators.	O	O
One of the biggest portions of the military budget, about $1 billion, would go on upgrading Japan’s PAC-3 Patriot surface-to-air missile defense systems to increase range and accuracy for deployment in 2020, the submitted proposal stated.	O	O
‘Red line’: China warned Japan against joining US freedom of navigation stuntsThe Japanese military also wants to develop a new submarine with advanced surveillance capabilities, work with the US on next-generation missile interceptors, station a 2,000-strong mobile amphibious unit near Nagasaki, and dispatch extra personnel in the Philippines and other Asian nations.	O	O
Tokyo may also purchase additional F-35 fighters jets from the US and develop better anti-ship missiles.	O	O
After coming to power in 2012, Abe overturned a decade of defense cuts and steered the country away from its post-World War Two pacifist stance by pushing for a larger role for the military.	O	O
The increasing militarization is opposed by large sections of Japanese society, but the mood appears to be changing amid growing tension with North Korea and China.	O	O
Pyongyang recently demonstrated progress in its missile program, successfully launching a ballistic missile from a submarine earlier in August.	O	O
Tokyo’s standoff with Beijing is focused on a chain of islands in the South China Sea, which both nations claim sovereignty over.	O	O
The Chinese claims are being challenged by Japan’s key military ally, the US, which has been sending warships and warplanes through the area.	O	O
Earlier this month Beijing warned that if Tokyo joined the American “freedom of navigation” missions, it would “cross a red line.	O	O
”Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida last week told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during talks in Tokyo that Chinese vessels must stop violating Japanese territory around the disputed islands.	O	O

Defense Ministry requests ¥5.1 trillion for fiscal 2017 to address new threats
The government is requesting a bigger budget for security as North Korea’s nuclear provocations and China’s military assertiveness continue to unsettle the region, and the Dhaka terror attack showed ordinary Japanese are also at risk.	B	Japan defence ministry seeks record budget
The Defense Ministry on Wednesday submitted its fiscal 2017 budget request totaling more than ¥5.1 trillion, up 2.3 percent from the fiscal 2016 budget.	O	O
The defense budget request has been increasing for the last five years, and this is the third year in a row the amount exceeded ¥5 trillion.	O	O
The ministry requested more than ¥100 billion to strengthen the intercept capability of the Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missiles to better counter North Korea’s enhanced missile capability.	O	O
The ministry also requested ¥14.7 billion to introduce the Standard Missile-3 Block IIA, which will intercept missiles in outer space.	O	O
To counter China’s increasing military assertiveness in the East China Sea, the ministry is requesting almost ¥75 billion to deploy Ground Self-Defense Force patrol units on Miyako Island in Okinawa Prefecture and on Amami Island in Kagoshima Prefecture.	O	O
Almost ¥9 billion will likely be earmarked for creating an amphibious unit to protect remote islands.	O	O
Some ¥94 billion is also sought to procure Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters to better secure Japan’s air supremacy in the event of a crisis.	O	O
The stealth jet will be rolled out in mid-September at Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth factory in Texas.	O	O
The defense budget boost comes amid the increasingly bellicose behavior of North Korea and China.	O	O
The North last week claimed to have successfully test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile, which would be difficult to intercept with the current missile defense system.	O	O
Chinese spy ships have been entering Japanese territorial waters despite Japan’s strong protests, while Air Self-Defense Force fighter jets scrambled a record 199 times against Chinese aircraft near Japanese airspace between April and June.	O	O
To counter the worsening security situation, the Japan Coast Guard also is also seeking a bigger budget — of more than ¥200 billion, up 7 percent from the previous year.	O	O
Last year, the Coast Guard formed a special unit to patrol the Japan- administered Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.	O	O
The uninhabited islets are also claimed by China and Taiwan, and called Diaoyu and Tiaoyutai, respectively.	O	O
The budget to patrol around the remote isles increased by almost 19 percent this year to almost ¥47 billion, which will partly be spent to deploy 190 new personnel in an effort to beef up patrols.	O	O
Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry on Wednesday submitted a budget request totaling ¥773 billion, up more than 8 percent from last year, mainly focusing on official development assistance and counterterrorism.	O	O
Japan’s ODA spending peaked in 1997, while global powers have aggressively spent funds in financial assistance.	O	O
But last year Tokyo increased its ODA budget for the first time in 17 years, and this year’s request also increased by 13 percent to more than ¥490 billion.	O	O
Some ¥11 billion in ODA money is requested for capacity-building in maritime patrols.	O	O
Japan has been aggressively providing patrol vessels to its Southeast Asian neighbors as part of ODA, but the budget has more than doubled this year.	O	O
The ministry is also beefing up security at overseas schools catering to Japanese students, following the terror attack in Dhaka that left seven Japanese nationals among the dead.	O	O
The ministry said it is requesting more than ¥1 billion to upgrade the facility, such as through building taller walls and installing iron bars on the windows to prevent attackers from entering the schools.	O	O

South Korean President Park Geun-hye walked with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in Entebbe on Sunday.
Uganda, one of North Korea’s closest allies in Africa, said after a visit from South Korea’s president that it would halt all military cooperation with Pyongyang to comply with U.N. sanctions.	B	Uganda
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni ordered his prime minister to ensure that relevant government departments sever all police and military ties with North Korea, deputy government spokesman Shaban Bantariza said.	O	O
“The directive takes immediate effect and is aimed at ensuring that Uganda complies with the U.N. resolution on North Korea,” he said.	O	O
An end to military links between Uganda and North Korea would represent a victory for South Korean President Park Geun-hye as she tries to disrupt Pyongyang’s diplomatic and financial network to discourage the country’s nuclear-arms development.	O	O
Ms.	O	O
Park, on a three-nation tour in Africa, met with Mr. Museveni on Sunday and the two discussed increasing economic and other links, according to a South Korean government spokesman.	O	O
A South Korean defense ministry spokesman said agreements on military cooperation were signed as well but declined to provide further details.	O	O
Uganda’s foreign ministry said 10 cooperation agreements were signed in areas including military, rural development, health, agriculture and information and communications technology.	O	O
Under the defense pact, Uganda and South Korea will “expand cooperation in the area of military technology and training” to help “fill the void created by the disengagement of defense and police cooperation with North Korea,” a ministry spokesman said.	O	O
Uganda security officials say North Korean instructors have been training Ugandan police in areas including forensic investigations, public-order management and handling of weapons such as pistols and AK-47s.	O	O
Under United Nations sanctions imposed following North Korea’s fourth nuclear test in January, weapons deals and military-training contracts with North Korea are banned.	O	O
Such trade has for decades been a source of cash and intelligence for North Korea.	O	O
Earlier in May, Ms.	O	O
Park visited Iran, another traditional ally of North Korea, and asked for its cooperation in pressuring Pyongyang.	O	O
Uganda’s military links to North Korea date back to the early 1970s when then-dictator Idi Amin signed an agreement with Pyongyang to provide training and weapons for his armed forces.	O	O
Since then, North Korea has mainly provided Uganda with support services, including arms maintenance.	O	O
A U.N. report this year said Uganda had confirmed North Korean military officials were training its police force as of the end of last year.	O	O
The panel also noted that military trainers from North Korea had been photographed wearing Ugandan air force uniforms.	O	O
Another Ugandan government spokesman told The Wall Street Journal last week that Uganda had training contracts with the North Korean military and was still importing arms from North Korea.	O	O
The two Koreas are locked in a battle for influence in Africa.	O	O
Late last week, a close aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met with a delegation from Mozambique in Pyongyang, according to North Korean state media reports.	O	O

Uganda has agreed to cut all military and police ties with North Korea, depriving the North of a crucial base for arms and other exports in Africa, the office of President Park Geun-hye of South Korea said on Monday.	O	O
President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda made that promise in a summit meeting with Ms.	O	O
Park on Sunday during her visit to Africa, her office said.	O	O
In the meeting, her office said, Mr. Museveni agreed to comply with United Nations sanctions aimed at limiting North Korea’s capacity to earn foreign cash for its banned nuclear and missile program.	O	O
“We are disengaging the cooperation we are having with North Korea, as a result of U.N. sanctions,” Sam Kutesa, Uganda’s foreign minister, told the Ugandan broadcaster NBS Television.	O	O
Col.	O	O
Shaban Bantariza, a spokesman for the Ugandan government, said his country was simply “disengaging from military cooperation” and not cutting diplomatic ties with the North Koreans, The Associated Press reported.	B	Uganda
North Korea, Always Quotable: 9 Memorable Statements From Kim Jong-un’s ReignNorth Korea makes few goods that the rest of the world wants, but it does specialize in exporting bombastic, bellicose pronouncements.	O	O
May 9, 2016Instructors from North Korea have been in Uganda for years, training its police in weapons use and in other areas, according to South Korean officials and a United Nations sanctions report.	O	O
Uganda was also believed to be a crucial buyer of rifles and other small arms from North Korea.	B	Uganda
Under economic pressure from international sanctions, North Korea has relied on the exports of weapons and the deployment of military instructors abroad as a source of foreign currency.	O	O
The United Nations vowed to crack down on these income sources in its latest sanctions, imposed after the North’s nuclear test in January.	O	O
North Korean officials have been visiting Uganda since the days of Kim Il-sung — grandfather of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un — who cultivated ties with African countries when he was president.	O	O
Mr. Museveni, in power since 1986, visited North Korea in 1987, 1990 and 1992 and met with Kim Il-sung.	O	O
When he visited South Korea in 2013, he surprised officials by greeting them in Korean; he said he had learned it from Kim Il-sung, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.	O	O
In 2014, he received a North Korean delegation led by Kim Yong-nam, the No. 2 man in the North’s hierarchy.	O	O
But that year, his government declined to receive an International Kim Il-sung Award that the North offered to Mr. Museveni, Yonhap reported.	O	O
The Park-Museveni agreement, if put into effect, would be a coup for Ms.	O	O
Park, who supports aggressive enforcement of United Nations sanctions against North Korea.	O	O
During her current three-nation tour in Africa, she has tried to rally support for the sanctions, offering aid packages as incentives.	O	O
During her visit, Uganda and South Korea signed 10 cooperation agreements in areas like defense, health, rural development and communications technology, both governments said.	O	O
South Korea has exported $350,000 worth of helmets, bulletproof jackets and grenades to Uganda in the last three years, according to South Korean government data.	O	O
For decades, South Korea and North Korea have tried to undercut each other’s influence in Africa.	O	O
The visit by Ms.	O	O
Park was the first state trip to Uganda by a South Korean president since the two nations established diplomatic relations in 1963.	O	O
On Tuesday, North Korea launched a missile, but the test ended in failure, the South Korean military said.	O	O
It was the latest in a recent string of test flops that have embarrassed Kim Jong-un, who has positioned his country’s missile and nuclear programs as his key achievement.	O	O
The North launched the missile from a site east of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, the South Korean military said in a statement.	O	O
It said the test was a failure, but it provided no further details, like the type of missile used, pending further analysis.	O	O

U.S. proposes restoring U.N. Western Sahara's mission's functionality

The United States has drafted a resolution calling for the urgent restoration of “full functionality” of the U.N.	O	O
Western Sahara mission, according to a copy of the text seen by Reuters.	O	O
Originally the council planned to vote on Thursday but delayed it by one day to allow more negotiations, diplomats said.	O	O
Morocco expelled dozens of international U.N. civilian staff from MINURSO after U.N.	O	O
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last month referred to the North African nation’s 1975 annexation of the region from Spain as an “occupation.	O	O
”The U.S. draft’s proposed terminology, council diplomats said, suggests the mission, known as MINURSO, should be restored to staffing levels comparable to what they were before the Moroccans ordered civilian personnel out of the country.	O	O
“Full functionality means being able to fulfill the whole mandate including the civilian part of the mandate, which has at its center the preparation of an eventual referendum on the political future of the territory,” a council diplomat said on condition of anonymity.

This view was echoed by Mhamed Khadad of the Sahrawi people’s Polisario Front separatist movement, which wants a referendum on independence for Western Sahara.	B	Western Sahara peacekeeping mission
Morocco says it will only grant autonomy.	O	O
Khadad told reporters that Polisario wants the council to ensure MINURSO fulfills it mandate to organize a referendum.	B	UN
Rabat said its decisions were irreversible, though one diplomat said the United States and Morocco were discussing MINURSO’s future at the foreign minister level.	O	O
The latest U.S. draft also calls for Ban to report within 120 days on whether MINURSO has “full functionality”.	O	O
Several council diplomats said Morocco’s traditional ally France, a permanent veto power on the council, along with Senegal opposed calling for “full functionality”.	O	O
Such a move, they said, risks making MINURSO’s reductions permanent.	O	O

The United States on Wednesday circulated a draft UN resolution that stresses the "urgent need" to restore the UN mission in Western Sahara after Morocco expelled dozens of staff, leaving peace operations hanging by a thread.	O	O
The Security Council is set to vote Friday on the draft text on renewing the MINURSO mission's mandate for a year amid sharp divisions on the council on the way forward.	O	O
The vote was postponed by a day to allow for more discussion.	O	O
Russia's Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said talks were "not going to be easy.	O	O

O	O
"An earlier text provided for a two-month deadline for the report.	O	O
That provision is expected to raise concerns among some council members who fear that Morocco, backed by France and Senegal, is seeking to delay action on re-establishing the full strength of the mission.	O	O

"- Watered down draft -Under the proposed measure, the 15-member council will "consider how best to facilitate" the mission's return to full capacity if the crisis over the peace mission is unresolved in four months.	O	O
A previous text contained stronger language, calling on the council to "take immediate measures" to restore the full functionality.	O	O
Churkin told reporters after a closed-door council meeting to discuss the draft that there was "room for improvement" and suggested that some council members were looking to strengthen the text.	O	O
Venezuela, Uruguay and New Zealand have argued strongly that Morocco should not be allowed to downsize MINURSO and that failure to take strong action would send a signal to other governemnts unhappy with a UN presence to do the same.	O	O

UN urged to restore Western Sahara peacekeeping mission
A proposed Security Council resolution calls for the urgent return of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the disputed Western Sahara to its full operation, in a strong rebuke to Morocco’s expulsion of most of its civilian staff.	B	UN urged to restore Western Sahara peacekeeping mission
The U.S.-drafted resolution, obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press, expresses concern at the U.N. mission’s inability to fully carry out its mandate of monitoring a 1991 cease-fire and organizing a referendum on the future of Western Sahara following Morocco’s action last month.	O	O
It also expresses concern at Morocco’s violation of agreements with the United Nations on the operation of the mission, known as MINURSO.	O	O
The draft resolution would extend the mandate of the mission until April 30, 2017 and “emphasize the urgent need for MINURSO to return to full functionality.	O	O
”It asks Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to report within 120 days on whether the mission’s full operations have been restored, and if not “to consider how best to facilitate achievement of this goal.	O	O
”MINURSO’s current mandate expires on Saturday and the Security Council was scheduled to vote on the draft resolution on Thursday.	O	O
But all 15 members only received the draft Wednesday afternoon, and Russia’s U.N.	O	O
Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said after closed consultations that “some council members did not feel it was strong enough.	O	O
”He said council experts will meet Thursday to go over the text, and from the tone of Wednesday’s consultations “these discussions are not going to be easy.	O	O
” But the council is under time pressure, he said, and members agreed to try to adopt the resolution on Friday.	O	O
Morocco annexed Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, in 1975 and fought a local independence movement called the Polisario Front.	O	O
The U.N. brokered a ceasefire in 1991 and established MINURSO to monitor it and help prepare a referendum, which has never taken place.	O	O
Morocco considers the mineral-rich region its “southern provinces” and has proposed wide-ranging autonomy, but the Polisario Front insists on self-determination through a referendum for the local population — as called for in U.N. resolutions, all of which are reaffirmed in the current draft.	B	Western Sahara
Last month, Morocco expelled over 70 U.N. civilians carrying out political activities, de-mining operations and other activities after secretary-general Ban used the word “occupation” in talking about Western Sahara following a visit to a camp for refugees from the region who have been in Algeria for over 40 years.	O	O
Ban and many council members have warned that the expulsion must be reversed because otherwise it will become a precedent and other countries with Security Council-mandated peacekeeping and political missions could decide to expel U.N. troops and staff as well.	B	Western Sahara peacekeeping mission
The Polisario Front’s MINURSO coordinator, Emhamed Khadad, accused Morocco at a press conference here earlier Wednesday of manufacturing the current crisis “to distract from its unwillingness to engage in meaningful negotiations on nothing more than a vote by the Saharwi people to determine their political future.”.

U.N. Renews Mission in Western Sahara in Divisive Vote
The United Nations Security Council on Friday renewed its peacekeeping mission in the disputed Western Sahara region for a year with a resolution that placed only mild pressure on Morocco, which in a diplomatic flare-up last month expelled many of the staff members of the mission, crippling its ability to function.	O	O
The resolution expressed the “urgent need” for a full restoration of the mission, known by its acronym, Minurso, and called on the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to report in three months whether it had been returned to “full functionality.	B	UN urged to restore Western Sahara peacekeeping mission
”The measure did not order the Moroccans to rescind the expulsions.	O	O
It also did not specify what further steps might be taken to resolve the mission’s severe limitations, which have raised fears of a return to armed conflict in Western Sahara, a mineral-rich region long claimed by Morocco.	O	O
The Security Council’s handling of the expulsions was under scrutiny by other nations where peacekeeping missions have been deployed.	O	O
Minurso has operated in Western Sahara for a quarter-century, helping to monitor a cease-fire between Moroccan forces and the Polisario Front, a pro-independence movement.	O	O
The effort to find a political solution has been foundering for years.	O	O
A crisis erupted last month after Mr. Ban visited a camp for displaced Western Saharans and described their region as “occupied,” infuriating the Moroccans who said Mr. Ban had abandoned neutrality on the issue.	B	Western Sahara
Mr. Ban and his aides denied the accusation, but Morocco’s government still ordered dozens of civilian staff members of Minurso to leave.	O	O
The resolution adopted on Friday, one day before Minurso’s mandate expired, reflected a willingness to compromise despite divisions within the 15-member Council.	O	O
Ten members approved the resolution, including the United States, which drafted it.	O	O
Venezuela and Uruguay opposed it, and Russia, Angola and New Zealand abstained.	O	O
Some dissenting diplomats said the resolution should have been worded much more sternly and Morocco given a short deadline to allow the mission to resume full operations.	B	UN urged to restore Western Sahara peacekeeping mission
The Polisario Front’s representative at the United Nations, Ahmed Boukhari, also criticized the measure for that reason.	O	O
“This resolution has dealt with the crisis in a soft manner,” Mr. Boukhari said in a phone interview.	B	UN urged to restore Western Sahara peacekeeping mission
“Why this accommodation with Morocco.	O	O
”Morocco welcomed the resolution.	O	O
The Moroccan American Center for Policy, a group of organizations that represent the views of the Moroccan government, said in a statement that the resolution’s language had reiterated the need for negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front based on “realism and a spirit of compromise.	O	O
”Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, acknowledged in remarks after the vote that the renewal of the Minurso mandate this year had been “challenging and contentious — that is an understatement.	B	UN urged to restore Western Sahara peacekeeping mission
”Ms.	I	UN urged to restore Western Sahara peacekeeping mission
Power hinted that the absence of forceful language in the resolution was deemed necessary to help create an atmosphere that would lead to Minurso’s restoration.	I	UN urged to restore Western Sahara peacekeeping mission
“It is important that Morocco and the United Nations have a constructive relationship,” she said.	O	O
“In fact, it is absolutely necessary if the U.N.-led process, which we all support, is to bring about a peaceful, sustainable, and mutually agreed solution to the conflict in Western Sahara.	B	UN urged to restore Western Sahara peacekeeping mission
”It was not clear how soon the resolution might help diminish any lingering frictions between Mr. Ban’s office and the Moroccan government.	O	O
Mr. Ban’s spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, told reporters at the United Nations, “We’re pleased that the resolution has passed.”.	B	UN urged to restore Western Sahara peacekeeping mission

Oil falls on output cut skepticism, OPEC and Russia output rise
Oil prices on Tuesday ended lower for the first time since OPEC agreed on Nov. 30 to cut output, as data showing record high production in the producer group fed skepticism that it would be able to reduce supplies.	O	O

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 86 cents to $50.93 per barrel.	O	O
Crude had surged more than 15 percent in the four sessions since the Nov. 30 OPEC meeting.	O	O
“Prices fell for the first day in five in reaction to news that OPEC’s output hit a record high last month,” said James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics in Arkansas.	O	O
OPEC’s output set another record high in November, rising to 34.19 million barrels per day (bpd) from 33.82 million bpd in October, according to a Reuters survey.	O	O
Oil prices pared losses slightly after inventory data released late Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude stocks dropped more than expected last week despite a hefty build of 4 million barrels in Cushing, Oklahoma.	O	O
[API/S]If the Cushing build is reinforced in Wednesday’s report from the U.S.	O	O
Energy Information Administration, that would signal the largest weekly rise since January 2009, data showed.	O	O
As part of last week’s decision, OPEC said major oil producers outside the group would cut 600,000 bpd of production on top of OPEC’s 1.2 million bpd reduction.	O	O
Those countries and OPEC meet this weekend to finalize the terms.	O	O
Russia reported average oil production in November of 11.21 million bpd, its highest in nearly 30 years.	O	O
That means OPEC and Russia alone produced enough to cover almost half of global oil demand, which is just above 95 million bpd.	O	O
Market watchers had said OPEC’s decision to cut output marked an about-face for Saudi Arabia, which has been battling to keep market share for the past two years by selling more, if cheaper, barrels rather than bolstering prices.	B	Non-Opec countries agree to cut oil output
But in a sign the fight for market share is not over, Saudi Aramco cut the January price for its Arab Light grade for Asian customers by $1.20 a barrel from December.	O	O
The U.S. EIA expects U.S. crude production to fall less than previously expected to 8.9 million bpd in 2016 and to 8.8 million bpd in 2017 from 9.4 million bpd in 2015, according to its monthly short term energy outlook.	O	O

Saudis order oil cuts to U.S., Europe before non-OPEC talks
Saudi Arabia has told its U.S. and European customers it will reduce oil deliveries from January, as Russia said it was confident non-OPEC producers would fully join OPEC’s output limits on Saturday in the first such move since 2001.	O	O
Khali desert, Saudi Arabia, November 14, 2007.	O	O
REUTERS/Ali Jarekji/File PhotoSaudi Arabia told the customers about lower supplies in line with the output reduction agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last week, according to a Gulf oil industry source familiar with Saudi oil policy.	O	O
“We told our customers of the allocations and the compliance with allocations (for the cuts) for Saudi Arabia is 100 percent,” the source said.	O	O
He said cuts to Asian refiners would be lower than those to Europe, the United States and to major oil companies.	O	O
“We are cutting more in the U.S. because the inventories are very high,” the source said.	O	O
OPEC will meet non-OPEC producing countries in Vienna on Saturday, hoping non-OPEC will commit to cutting 600,000 barrels per day after its own members agreed to cut 1.2 million bpd last week.	O	O
OPEC sources said nine non-OPEC countries were set to join the meeting: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Oman, Mexico, Russia, Sudan, South Sudan, Bahrain and Malaysia.	O	O
Bolivia may also attend the talks, according to an OPEC source.	O	O
Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid al-Falih said he was “very optimistic” about the Saturday meeting.	O	O
“We will know the exact numbers tomorrow but I am expecting about 10 to 11 (non-OPEC) countries to be on the final declaration with specific numbers,” he told reporters upon arriving to Vienna.	O	O
So far only Russia and Oman have pledged cuts, with one OPEC source saying Mexico could also contribute as much as 150,000 bpd.	O	O
In contrast, Kazakhstan plans to boost output in 2017 as it launches the long-delayed Kashagan project.	O	O
Russia is expected to shoulder half of the non-OPEC cut, but on Friday sources in Moscow signalled there were snags that needed to be addressed before a deal could be reached, including full compliance with cuts by all parties involved.	O	O
However, Russia’s energy minister told reporters upon arriving in Vienna he expected non-OPEC oil producers to fully contribute to production cuts agreed earlier with OPEC.	O	O
“I look with optimism at tomorrow’s event,” said Alexander Novak.	O	O
“I think that we will agree and we must agree.	O	O
”NO CUTS FOR ASIA OPEC’s second largest producer Iraq has notified U.S. and European buyers of its crude about planned cuts, according to an industry source familiar with the matter.	O	O
State-run Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) said it planned to notify its international crude customers soon about reductions to their allocations.	O	O
Iraq and Kuwait have committed to cuts to their oil outputs of 210,000 bpd and 131,000 bpd respectively under the OPEC deal.	O	O
Sources at eight refiners in Asia told Reuters they had been notified by state oil giant Saudi Aramco that in January it was set to supply full crude amounts.	O	O
Of those eight, three refiners said they would load extra volumes they had requested.	O	O
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.	O	O
“It’s quite telling as there are not only no supply cuts, but they have given extra volumes,” one of the sources said, indicating that the move underscored that producers were eager to maintain market share in fast-growing Asian markets.	O	O
Some of the extra volumes were committed before the OPEC meeting on Nov. 30, when output cuts were agreed.	O	O
“It seems that Saudis do not trust Mr. Sechin after his mockings back in 2008/2009 as he repeatedly promised and disappointed them on cuts,” Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg told the Reuters Global Oil Forum, referring to Igor Sechin, the CEO of top Russian oil producer Rosneft (ROSN.	O	O
MM).	O	O
“I see the Saudi strategy for January deliveries to Asia as a confirmation of this distrust.	O	O
”Sechin has long been a harsh critic of cooperation with OPEC.	O	O
However, Sechin has kept a low profile recently and this week agreed to sell a stake in Rosneft to a consortium of commodities trader Glencore (GLEN.L) and Qatar - a key ally of Saudi Arabia in OPEC.	O	O

Omani oil and gas minister Mohammad bin Hamad al-Rumhy told reporters that non-OPEC producers’ current discussions to cut between 3 and 4 percent of their oil production, is less than what Oman was ready to reduce output by.	O	O
He declined to comment on how much Oman is prepared to cut output, but Oman has previously said it would be willing to cut production by 5-10 percent.	B	cut oil output
Rumhy said he expected oil prices to rise to a range of $50-$60 a barrel in 2017 after the global oil limiting supply agreement.	O	O
Oman’s oil production is around 1 million bpd.	O	O
Rumhy, who is also the chairman of Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), the country’s top oil and gas exploration and production company, said PDO’s expected investments next year will be around $4 billion.	O	O
“Recently, we were discussing the amount PDO plans to borrow next year.	O	O
It will be almost the same as this year’s loan.	O	O
Between $3-$5 billion,” he said.	O	O
In June, PDO said it obtained a $4 billion loan from international banks, part of a rush of foreign borrowing by Oman as low oil prices strain state finances.	O	O

Oil prices jump after non-OPEC accord
OPEC oil-producing countries have joined OPEC members in agreeing to cut oil production and oil Prices are surging as a result.	O	O
Video provided by TheStreet NewslookOil prices jumped Monday after several nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached a deal to cut oil production.	O	O
OPEC accord on Saturday came on the heels of an OPEC deal in late November to cut production for at least six months.	O	O
The deals reflect a coordinated attempt to bolster global petroleum prices and reduce excess inventory after two years of weakness for the commodity.	O	O
The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the U.S. benchmark, rose 3.4% to $53.27 per barrel Monday.	O	O
Brent crude, the global benchmark, increased 3.2% to $56.07.	O	O
Non-OPEC member countries committed to cut 558,000 barrels per day after OPEC countries agreed to reduce production by 1.2 million per day.	O	O
OPEC had previously announced that non-member countries would shed 600,000 barrels per day.	O	O
Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin said in a research note that the deals are enough to sustain oil prices at about $55 per barrel in the first half of 2017.	O	O
Prices could head higher for a period, Courvalin said, but the onset of new production in the U.S. is likely to keep prices contained.	O	O
"Ultimately, this remains a short duration cut in our view," he said.	O	O
The outside nations agreeing to caps were Azerbaijan, Kingdom of Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Russia, Republic of Sudan and Republic of South Sudan.	O	O
To monitor commitment to the output-cutting deal, two non-OPEC countries will join a monitoring committee.	O	O
OPEC countries are notorious historically for cheating on their own production deals.	O	O
"Some justifiable doubts will remain over the implementation of the production quotas which have been announced, but the ability of Saudi Arabia and Russia to come to an agreement in the current climate has to be seen as a significant statement of intent which cannot fail to have an impact on markets," JBC Energy analysts said Monday in a research note.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had previously agreed to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), and on Saturday, 11 non-OPEC producers agreed to join the effort and reduce output by 558,000 bpd.	O	O

The agreement was followed by comments from top exporter Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid Al-Falih saying that the kingdom may be willing to cut output to below 10 million bpd.	O	O
The world’s top oil exporter told OPEC it pumped a record 10.72 million bpd last month, an OPEC source said, up from 10.625 million bpd in October.	O	O
Goldman said an announced production cut from Russia was likely to remain short of the 300,000 bpd promised, noting that Russia’s participation was important.	O	O
Goldman said implementation of the co-ordinated OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts was required to sustainably support spot oil prices at its H1 2017 price forecast of $55/bbl for West Texas Intermediate crude.	O	O
A better-than-expected compliance would initially lead to higher prices, “with full compliance worth an additional $6/bbl to our price forecast,” it said.	O	O
The bank warned, however, that as WTI prices neared $55 a barrel, that producers, especially in the United States, might begin to raise their output.	O	O
“Ultimately, this remains a short duration cut in our view, targeting excess inventories and not high oil prices,” Goldman said.	B	Non-Opec countries agree to cut oil output to ease glut

OPEC sees robust oil demand growth even if prices rise
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries expects oil demand in 2017 to be as robust as this year, the group’s secretary general told an energy conference on Monday, though recently agreed production cuts could raise prices for buyers.	O	O

Peter BaderMohammed Sanusi Barkindo, briefing reporters on the sidelines of India’s Petrotech energy conference, said Asia would have a big role to play in the demand growth and that there was plenty of room for OPEC and non-OPEC countries to grow in the global oil market.	B	Non-Opec countries
OPEC last week agreed its first oil output cuts since 2008, looking to reduce production by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) beginning in January to try to reduce global oversupply and prop up prices.	O	O
It hopes non-OPEC countries will contribute another 600,000 bpd to the cut.	O	O
Barkindo said OPEC has invited non-OPEC countries Russia, Colombia, Congo, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Oman, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Bolivia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain and Brunei to a meeting on Dec. 10 to discuss their contribution.	O	O
“We want the inventory level to be at a past 5 year average, not more and not less than that,” he said.	O	O
Oil prices have risen since the production agreement, with benchmark Brent crude oil futures soaring on Monday to its highest since July 6, 2015 to $55.20 a barrel.	O	O
[O/R]This has worried big buyers like India, which imports more than 80 percent of its crude oil and has benefited from two years of soft prices.	O	O
Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told the conference oil producing countries “must match security of supply with security of demand” when deciding prices.	O	O
“We are expecting growth next year as robust as this year, in the region of around 1.2 million bpd,” Barkindo said.	B	Non-Opec countries agree to cut oil output to ease glut

”He said oil consumers wanted stability in the market to ensure that future supply was guaranteed.	O	O
He also said that OPEC members were investing heavily to ensure supplies could meet global oil demand, which is likely to continue to rise steadily.	O	O
“Alone in India, oil demand is projected to rise to more than 10 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2040, from 4.1 million barrels per day now,” Barkindo said.	O	O
Overall, OPEC estimates that world oil demand will rise by 17 million bpd to around 110 million bpd by 2040.	O	O

Hedge funds establish record bullish position in oil after OPEC
Hedge funds were badly caught out by the production cuts announced by OPEC at the end of last month, triggering a furious rally as managers raced to buy back loss-making short positions.	O	O
A flag with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) logo is seen before a news conference at OPEC's headquarters in Vienna, Austria December 10, 2016.	O	O
Peter BaderWhen OPEC announced a deal had been reached on Nov. 30, a substantial number of short positions were still uncovered, providing the opportunity for a classic squeeze.	O	O
Now the hedge fund community has turned its bearish position going into the meeting into the largest bullish position on record.	O	O
Hedge funds and cut their short positions in Brent and WTI futures and options by 134 million barrels in the week to Dec. 6 (tmsnrt.rs/2gwFSXn).	O	O
Fund managers also added 94 million barrels of fresh long positions, according to positioning data published by regulators and exchanges.	O	O
The shift from short-to-long amounted to a record 228 million barrels in a single week, and took the total net long position to 728 million barrels, which was also a record (tmsnrt.rs/2hm1C5f).	O	O
There has never been a comparable shift from bearishness to bullishness among speculators over such a short space of time in the last 25 years.	O	O
The scale of the turn round explains why Brent prices jumped by more than $7.50 per barrel or 16 percent in the week following the OPEC meeting.	O	O
USING SHOCK AND AWE By the end of Dec. 6, however, most hedge fund short positions in Brent and WTI had been closed out, which explains why the upward momentum which had carried prices higher began to stall.	O	O
The faltering rally left Brent trading below $54 per barrel, which probably disappointed Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members, hoping to be rewarded with a bigger jump.	O	O
Most analysts and traders expected OPEC to deliver only around half of the promised cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (“OPEC expected to deliver only half of target production cut”, Reuters, Dec. 6).	O	O
As a result, crude stocks were expected to remain high throughout the first half of 2017, before starting to draw down in the second half (“Oil traders see no market rebalancing until later in 2017”, Reuters, Dec. 8).	O	O
But the announcement of a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC countries on Dec. 10 has given the rally renewed momentum.	O	O
Saudi Arabia has sought to drive oil prices higher again using “shock and awe” tactics by assembling unexpectedly large production cuts from an unusually broad group of non-OPEC countries.	O	O
Eleven non-OPEC countries have pledged to reduce their oil output by a combined total of 558,000 barrels per day, voluntarily or through managed decline, starting in January 2017.	O	O
Most of the cuts and declines will come from Russia, Mexico Oman and Azerbaijan with token contributions from other countries.	O	O
Production cuts will initially last for six months, but will be extendable for a further six months, depending on market conditions, according to a press statement released by OPEC.	O	O
Output reductions will be carried out concurrently with cuts of almost 1.2 million barrels per day agreed by OPEC at the end of November (“OPEC deal expected to tighten oil market in 2017”, Reuters, Dec. 1).	O	O
The global agreement is intended to accelerate oil market rebalancing by drawing down some of the excess inventories built up over the last two years.	O	O
TOWARDS BACKWARDATION Some analysts have expressed doubts about whether the deal really will cut crude oil supplies and reduce stock levels.	O	O
Past experience suggests there is significant potential for non-compliance.	O	O
The deal does not restrict output from U.S. shale producers, who are likely to respond to higher prices by increasing their production.	O	O
The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has already risen by 182 or 58 percent since hitting a low at the end of May.	O	O
And OPEC’s agreement leaves strife-torn Nigeria and Libya free to increase their production if they can re-establish security around oil installations.	O	O
For now, however, most traders seem convinced the market will rebalance with a big drawdown in crude stocks, but from the second half of 2017.	O	O
Brent futures prices continue to trade in a wide contango during the first six months of 2017, signaling that traders think stocks will remain high.	O	O
But the contango has vanished for the second half of the year and futures prices in 2018 are now trading in backwardation, suggesting most traders think stocks will be falling by then (tmsnrt.rs/2hm4zT1).	O	O

The deal helped U.S. crude gain more than 20 percent in about a month, leading some brokerages to expect some profit-taking, particularly as it is unclear whether the proposed cuts can be maintained.	O	O
However, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday it believes OPEC produced about 34.2 million barrels a day in November, or an additional 500,000 bpd from OPEC’s estimate.	O	O

So far only Russia and Oman have pledged cuts, with one OPEC source saying Mexico could also contribute as much as 150,000 bpd.	O	O
In contrast, Kazakhstan plans to boost output in 2017 as it launches the long-delayed Kashagan project.	O	O
Russia is expected to shoulder half of the non-OPEC cut, but on Friday sources in Moscow signalled there were snags that needed to be addressed before a deal could be reached, including full compliance with cuts by all parties involved.	O	O
However, Russia’s energy minister told reporters upon arriving in Vienna he expected non-OPEC oil producers to fully contribute to production cuts agreed earlier with OPEC.	O	O
“I look with optimism at tomorrow’s event,” said Alexander Novak.	O	O
“I think that we will agree and we must agree.	O	O
”NO CUTS FOR ASIA OPEC’s second largest producer Iraq has notified U.S. and European buyers of its crude about planned cuts, according to an industry source familiar with the matter.	O	O
State-run Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) said it planned to notify its international crude customers soon about reductions to their allocations.	O	O
Iraq and Kuwait have committed to cuts to their oil outputs of 210,000 bpd and 131,000 bpd respectively under the OPEC deal.	O	O
Sources at eight refiners in Asia told Reuters they had been notified by state oil giant Saudi Aramco that in January it was set to supply full crude amounts.	O	O
Of those eight, three refiners said they would load extra volumes they had requested.	O	O
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.	O	O
“It’s quite telling as there are not only no supply cuts, but they have given extra volumes,” one of the sources said, indicating that the move underscored that producers were eager to maintain market share in fast-growing Asian markets.	B	Non-Opec countries agree to cut oil output to ease glut
Some of the extra volumes were committed before the OPEC meeting on Nov. 30, when output cuts were agreed.	O	O
“It seems that Saudis do not trust Mr. Sechin after his mockings back in 2008/2009 as he repeatedly promised and disappointed them on cuts,” Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg told the Reuters Global Oil Forum, referring to Igor Sechin, the CEO of top Russian oil producer Rosneft.	B	Non-Opec countries agree to cut oil output to ease glut
“I see the Saudi strategy for January deliveries to Asia as a confirmation of this distrust.	O	O
”Sechin has long been a harsh critic of cooperation with OPEC.	O	O
However, Sechin has kept a low profile recently and this week agreed to sell a stake in Rosneft to a consortium of commodities trader Glencore and Qatar - a key ally of Saudi Arabia in OPEC.	O	O

Oil falls on output cut skepticism, OPEC and Russia output rise
Oil prices on Tuesday ended lower for the first time since OPEC agreed on Nov. 30 to cut output, as data showing record high production in the producer group fed skepticism that it would be able to reduce supplies.	O	O

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 86 cents to $50.93 per barrel.	O	O
Crude had surged more than 15 percent in the four sessions since the Nov. 30 OPEC meeting.	O	O
“Prices fell for the first day in five in reaction to news that OPEC’s output hit a record high last month,” said James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics in Arkansas.	O	O
OPEC’s output set another record high in November, rising to 34.19 million barrels per day (bpd) from 33.82 million bpd in October, according to a Reuters survey.	O	O
Oil prices pared losses slightly after inventory data released late Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude stocks dropped more than expected last week despite a hefty build of 4 million barrels in Cushing, Oklahoma.	O	O

Energy Information Administration, that would signal the largest weekly rise since January 2009, data showed.	O	O
As part of last week’s decision, OPEC said major oil producers outside the group would cut 600,000 bpd of production on top of OPEC’s 1.2 million bpd reduction.	O	O
Those countries and OPEC meet this weekend to finalize the terms.	O	O
Russia reported average oil production in November of 11.21 million bpd, its highest in nearly 30 years.	O	O
That means OPEC and Russia alone produced enough to cover almost half of global oil demand, which is just above 95 million bpd.	O	O
Market watchers had said OPEC’s decision to cut output marked an about-face for Saudi Arabia, which has been battling to keep market share for the past two years by selling more, if cheaper, barrels rather than bolstering prices.	O	O
But in a sign the fight for market share is not over, Saudi Aramco cut the January price for its Arab Light grade for Asian customers by $1.20 a barrel from December.	O	O
The U.S. EIA expects U.S. crude production to fall less than previously expected to 8.9 million bpd in 2016 and to 8.8 million bpd in 2017 from 9.4 million bpd in 2015, according to its monthly short term energy outlook.	O	O

Oil output cut deal aimed at inventories, not just raising prices: Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs said the formal agreement by non-OPEC oil producers this weekend in Vienna to help curb output was reached with a goal of “normalization” of inventories and not necessarily just at raising oil prices.	B	Non-Opec countries agree to cut oil output to ease glut
A flag with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) logo is seen before a news conference at OPEC's headquarters in Vienna, Austria December 10, 2016.	O	O
Peter BaderThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had previously agreed to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), and on Saturday, 11 non-OPEC producers agreed to join the effort and reduce output by 558,000 bpd.	O	O
The cut was short of an initial target of 600,000 bpd but still the first OPEC/non-OPEC output deal since 2001 and the largest contribution by non-OPEC producers ever.	O	O
“Despite the smaller-than-preannounced cut, the agreement is nonetheless noteworthy as it lifts the uncertainty on the potential participation of non-OPEC producers to the OPEC cut,” the bank said in a note on Sunday.	B	Non-Opec countries agree to cut oil output to ease glut
The agreement was followed by comments from top exporter Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid Al-Falih saying that the kingdom may be willing to cut output to below 10 million bpd.	O	O
The world’s top oil exporter told OPEC it pumped a record 10.72 million bpd last month, an OPEC source said, up from 10.625 million bpd in October.	O	O
Goldman said an announced production cut from Russia was likely to remain short of the 300,000 bpd promised, noting that Russia’s participation was important.	O	O
Goldman said implementation of the coordinated OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts was required to support spot oil prices at its H1 2017 price forecast of $55/bbl for West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1.	O	O
[O/R]A better-than-expected compliance would initially lead to higher prices, “with full compliance worth an additional $6/bbl to our price forecast,” it said.	O	O
The bank warned, however, that as WTI prices neared $55 a barrel, that producers, especially in the United States, might begin to raise their output.	O	O
“Ultimately, this remains a short duration cut in our view, targeting excess inventories and not high oil prices,” Goldman said.	B	cut oil output to ease glut

OPEC signals larger 2017 oil surplus, unless cuts implemented
OPEC on Wednesday signaled a growing oil supply surplus next year unless members implement their deal to curb output from record levels and outside producers also deliver on cutback pledges made at the weekend.	O	O
A flag with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) logo is seen before a news conference at OPEC's headquarters in Vienna, Austria December 10, 2016.	O	O
Peter BaderThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 33.87 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, according to figures OPEC collects from secondary sources, up 150,000 bpd from October, OPEC said in a monthly report.	O	O
OPEC’s own figures show the group’s output has continued to rise, adding to a global glut, ahead of the January start of its first supply cut agreement since 2008.	O	O
This could raise questions about its ability to comply fully with the deal.	O	O
But OPEC was hopeful that supply curbs pledged by Russia and other non-members at the weekend, in addition to its own reductions, will tackle the surplus and support prices, which at $55 a barrel LCOc1 are still half the level of mid-2014.	O	O
The non-OPEC cuts should help to “accelerate the reduction of global inventories and bring forward the rebalancing of the oil market to the second half of 2017,” OPEC said in the report.	O	O
To speed it up, OPEC last month finalised a plan to cut output by about 1.20 million bpd from Jan. 1 to 32.50 million bpd.	O	O
On Saturday, non-member countries pledged curbs of around 560,000 bpd in the first such move since 2001.	O	O
The report is the latest to show output hitting new peaks.	O	O
The November OPEC production figure is the highest since at least 2008, according to a Reuters review of past OPEC reports.	O	O
OPEC’s figures show more than two-thirds of November’s extra barrels came from Libya and Nigeria, both of which are exempt from cutting output because their production has been curbed by conflict.	O	O
Total output is 1.37 million bpd above the new target.	O	O
In the report, OPEC raised its forecast of non-OPEC supply slightly in 2017 to 300,000 bpd, although it said the forecast was under review following Saturday’s meeting.	O	O
With the demand for OPEC crude in 2017 expected to average 32.63 million bpd, the report indicates there will be an average surplus of 1.24 million bpd if OPEC keeps output steady.	O	O
Last month’s report pointed to a 950,000 bpd surplus.	O	O
OPEC did not give a detailed forecast of the outlook if all parties cut supply as promised.	O	O
The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday the market could show a shortfall of 600,000 bpd early next year in this scenario.	O	O

Oil slips on bearish U.S. inventory report, doubts over OPEC cut

The U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA said crude inventories fell 2.4 million barrels during the week ended Dec. 2, which was more than the 1 million-barrel draw analysts had forecast in a Reuters poll.	O	O

Reaction to the EIA report was muted, analysts said, in part because the results were similar to the data published by the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, late on Tuesday.	O	O
“Focus at the moment is on the key producers and OPEC and growing doubts non-OPEC producers will be able to come up with 600,000 barrels of cuts,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky.	B	Non-Opec countries agree to cut oil output to ease glut

Poll: OPEC deal will pack little punch in raising oil prices
OPEC’s landmark oil-production deal may prove effective in running down global inventories, but analysts hold little hope for much of a rise in prices, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.	O	O

Only five non-OPEC producers so far attending talks to widen output cut
Only five of 14 non-OPEC oil producers have agreed so far to meet the group on Saturday for talks aimed at widening a deal to reduce output, casting doubt on whether OPEC will secure the full cuts it is seeking, two OPEC sources said.	O	O
The OPEC logo is seen outside their headquarters in Vienna, Austria, October 24, 2016.	O	O
REUTERS/Leonhard FoegerThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which finalised its first oil output cut in eight years last month to prop up prices, is to hold talks with non-member countries in Vienna in the hope that they will also limit supply.	O	O
The last time non-OPEC countries joined the organization in cutting output, in late 2001 as prices dropped in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, non-members promised cuts of 462,000 barrels per day, not quite the 500,000 bpd OPEC then sought.	O	O
Currently, Russia has said it will cut 300,000 bpd, meaning other non-OPEC producers combined will need to pledge the same amount to lower output by the 600,000 bpd OPEC wants - half the reduction OPEC is making.	O	O
Some OPEC sources familiar with discussions were reasonably sure the outside producers would deliver enough commitments.	O	O
“I think they will,” said one.	O	O
“It should not be that difficult.	O	O
”Other OPEC sources were skeptical a pledge for the full amount would be made this time.	O	O
Among the 14 non-OPEC countries invited to attend Saturday’s meeting, only Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Oman, Mexico and Russia have accepted.	O	O
“It’s not clear,” a second source said.	O	O
“Wait until Saturday.	O	O
”A third OPEC source said cut pledges amounting to 500,000 bpd were more likely.	O	O
Besides Russia, only Oman has publicly stated it is willing to cut production.	O	O
In public comments, Azerbaijan has indicated it will lower supply, while Kazakhstan has said it is undecided.	O	O
OPEC President Mohammed al-Sada, speaking at the Nov. 30 news conference after OPEC finalised its output reduction, was confident that non-OPEC would deliver the 600,000 bpd.	O	O
Saturday’s meeting at OPEC’s Vienna headquarters will start at 10:00 a.m. local time (0900 GMT) and be chaired jointly by Sada and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, according to a draft copy of the agenda seen by Reuters.	O	O
OPEC will still implement its cut of 1.2 million bpd even if Russia becomes the only non-member to contribute, OPEC member Nigeria said on Wednesday.	O	O

Oil hits highest since mid-2015 on non-OPEC cut agreement
Oil rose to an 18-month high on Monday after OPEC and some of its rivals reached their first deal since 2001 to jointly reduce output to tackle global oversupply, though prices slipped late in the day.	O	O
On Saturday, producers from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Russia, agreed to reduce output by 558,000 barrels per day, short of the target of 600,000 bpd but still the largest non-OPEC contribution ever.	O	O
That followed OPEC’s Nov. 30 deal to cut output by 1.2 million bpd for six months from Jan. 1.	O	O
Top exporter Saudi Arabia will cut around 486,000 bpd to reduce the supply glut that has dogged markets for two years.	O	O
Crude futures have rallied sharply, with U.S. oil futures gaining 23 percent since the middle of November as optimism that an agreement would be reached started to grow.	O	O
There is some concern amongst analysts that the big move in crude is not sustainable, and that the market may have overshot given the expectation that various producers would not comply with the cuts they agreed upon.	O	O
“Right now the market is kind of feeding on itself,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.	O	O
“The market could push another $1 to $2 up to $55, and Brent could go to about $60, but at that point there are some concerns that are going to start to cap the rally.	O	O
”On Monday, U.S. crude futures settled up $1.33 at $52.83 a barrel, a 2.6 percent gain, though that was sharply off the day’s highs.	O	O
Prices continued to fall following settlement, with crude up just 98 cents to $52.48 at 3:22 p.m.	O	O
ET.	O	O
Brent crude futures settled up $1.36 at $55.69 per barrel, a 2.5 percent rise, after hitting a session peak of $57.89, highest since July 2015.	O	O
“Overnight we had a knee-jerk rally to the highs, but the market is going to try to analyse” the non-OPEC agreement going forward, said Andrew Lebow, managing partner at Commodity Research Group.	O	O
For the deal to be effective, all parties must stick to their word.	O	O
Higher prices also raise the chances of other producers boosting output, particularly U.S. shale operators, where rig counts have grown steadily in recent months.U.S. production remains about 1 million bpd below its peak of 9.6 million reached in 2015, according to U.S.	O	O
Energy Department data.	O	O
Further, several of the non-OPEC countries are still increasing their production.	O	O
Russia, for instance, does not expect to reach its target until April or May, and several other countries are expected to experience only natural declines, which will not necessarily affect the supply situation.	O	O

Russia to hold additional talks before OPEC, non-OPEC meeting
Russia has committed to reduce its output by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 in an effort to boost oil prices.	O	O
OPEC countries are being urged to cut by a similar amount in total.	O	O
OPEC, which produces a third of global oil, pledged on Nov. 30 to reduce output by around 1.2 million bpd from January 2017.	O	O
Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are the second- and third-biggest oil producers among ex-Soviet countries after Russia.	O	O
Both have confirmed their participation in the talks between OPEC and non-OPEC producers on Saturday.	O	O
“Russia sees risks ahead of the deal if questions are not resolved,” the source said.	O	O
“One hundred percent compliance is critical for the deal.	O	O
It’s essential for non-OPEC to have a responsible approach towards the deal.	O	O
”The source did not identify the non-OPEC countries to which he was referring.	O	O
The Russian Energy Ministry did not reply to a Reuters request for immediate comment.	O	O
Energy Minister Alexander Novak plans to attend the Dec. 10 talks.	O	O
The source also said there were questions regarding compliance by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, pointing to an increase in oil production by the group in November.	O	O
OPEC output rose by 370,000 bpd last month, a Reuters survey showed.	O	O
A Gulf oil industry source familiar with Saudi oil policy said on Friday that Saudi Arabia had informed customers about lower oil supplies from January in line with the reduction in output agreed by OPEC last week.	O	O
Kazakhstan, which relaunched its giant Kashagan oilfield in November, may offer to freeze oil output at last month’s level, Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said on Friday.	O	O
Russia’s output reached a post-Soviet high of 11.21 million bpd, the world’s largest, in November.	O	O
Russian energy officials have said Russia would cut from November-December levels.	O	O
Iranian news agency SHANA quoted Iranian President Hassan Rouhani as telling his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro it was important for OPEC to execute the output deal in the first half of 2017 and that cooperation from non-OPEC was essential.	O	O

Saudi Arabia cuts January oil price to Asia to four-month low to keep market share
Saudi Aramco has cut the January price for its Arab Light crude for Asian customers to the lowest in four months as it holds to a strategy of preserving market share in the world’s fastest-growing demand center.	O	O
Khali desert, Saudi Arabia, November 14, 2007.	O	O
REUTERS/Ali Jarekji/File PhotoThe price cuts are meant to ensure that Aramco can still sell more oil into Asia even after going along with the OPEC-Russia deal to cut output.	O	O
The Saudis have been struggling over the last two years to fight off increased competition from other producers in the Middle East, Russia and the Atlantic Basin.	O	O
Saudi Aramco said on Tuesday it cut the price of Arab Light crude sales to Asia by $1.20 a barrel versus December to a discount of $0.75 a barrel to the Oman/Dubai average.	O	O
January’s price cuts of $0.60-$1.50 across all Saudi crude grades are small compared with a near $10 a barrel gain in global benchmark Brent futures in the past week.	O	O
Brent hit 16-month high on Monday after OPEC and Russia struck a deal last week to cut production from January.	O	O
[O/R]“Ahead of the OPEC cut, producers are pumping at maximum output, so they must price to sell,” said a trader with a North Asian refiner who declined to be named due to company policy.	O	O
Russian oil production hit an all time high in November, according to official energy ministry data, while a Reuters survey found that output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was also at a record for the month.	O	O
Prior to the OPEC output deal, Saudi Aramco agreed to supply some customers in Asia with additional oil that will load in January to help them meet winter demand.	O	O
The company raised its Arab Light OSP to Northwest Europe by $0.30 a barrel for January from the previous month at a discount of $4.20 a barrel to the Brent Weighted Average (BWAVE).	O	O
The Arab Light OSP to the United States was set at a premium of $0.05 a barrel to the Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI) for January, down $0.30 a barrel from the previous month.	O	O
Because the Brent to Dubai Arab Light prompt month spread rose to $3.15 a barrel from $2.55 after the OPEC deal, Saudi Arabia had more leeway to raise their OSPs to Europe and remain competitive, said Jeff Quigley, Energy Markets Director at Stratas Advisors, a Houston-based consultancy.	B	Non-Opec countries agree to cut oil output to ease glut

Oil rises on Goldman forecast, signs producers complying with cuts
Oil rose on Friday, edging closer to new 17-month highs, after Goldman Sachs boosted its price forecast for 2017 and producers showed signs of adhering to a global deal to reduce output.	O	O

That put both contracts on track to rise for a fourth week in the last five, with Brent up around 23 percent during that time and U.S. crude up about 20 percent.	O	O
The premium of the Brent front-month over the same U.S. contract closed at $2.26 a barrel, its highest since the end of August.	O	O
“We’re up today because Goldman Sachs bumped up its oil estimates and the Russians said their oil companies would reduce output,” said Phil Davis, managing partner of venture capital fund PSW Investments in Woodland Park, New Jersey.	O	O
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to reduce output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1, its first such deal since 2008.	O	O
Russia and other non-OPEC producers plan to cut about half as much.	O	O
Those deals, clinched over the past two weeks, have boosted expectations that a two-year supply overhang will clear soon and prices remain near highs last seen in July 2015.	O	O
Russia said on Friday that all of the country’s oil companies, including top producer Rosneft, had agreed to reduce output.	O	O
Other oil producers including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have notified customers that they will cut from January.	O	O
“While the market will eventually need to see some evidence of an actual reduction in output, talk of production cuts and notices of lower allocations sent to refiners are sufficient to support market sentiment for now,” Tim Evans, Citi Futures’ energy futures specialist, said in a note.	B	Non-Opec countries agree to cut oil output to ease glut
The prospect of lower production led U.S. bank Goldman Sachs to raise its WTI price forecast for the second quarter of 2017 to $57.50 per barrel from $55.	O	O
However, there are doubts about the willingness of other OPEC members to reduce output.	O	O
Iraq, OPEC’s second-biggest producer after Saudi Arabia, has signed new deals that will increase sales to Asian customers such as China and India despite its commitment to reduce output by 210,000 bpd.	O	O
Libya, which is allowed to ramp up production as part of the OPEC deal, is close to increasing output crimped by unrest after a group of oil guards said they reopened a long-blockaded pipeline linking some of the country’s biggest oilfields.	B	Non-Opec countries agree to cut oil output to ease glut

Will President Obama's recently proposed tax on oil do anything to help drivers who spend an estimated 7 billion hours a year stuck in traffic.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
Definitely not, according to experts now analyzing the $10.25 a barrel tax in the proposed fiscal 2017 budget that the president unveiled today.	I	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
- that's about it," said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, a website that helps motorists to find low gas prices in the U.S.	O	O
At best, Obama's proposal for a tax on big oil to fund projects such as self-driving cars "serves less as a practical proposal than as aspirational vision," said Dr.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
Alan Krupnick, co-director of the RFF Center for Energy and Climate Economics.	O	O
Play VideoThe Republican-controlled Congress has already rejected the $4.15 trillion proposed budget sight unseen, and committees in both the Senate and House of Representatives have snubbed an opportunity to meet with Obama's budget director.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
"This isn't a budget so much as a progressive manual for growing the federal government at the expense of hardworking Americans," said House Speaker Paul Ryan.	I	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
Ryan singled out the president's proposed oil tax specifically, saying it "would raise the average cost of gasoline by 24 cents per gallon while hurting jobs and a major sector of our economy.	O	O
"The oil tax proposal is a disappointment even to people in academics and politics who recognize the problems with America's ailing roads and infrastructure and the need to find money for improvement.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
The American Society of Civil Engineers "report card" gives the U.S. a "D+" rating and says the country will need $3.6 trillion by 2020 to maintain it in good repair.	O	O
Among the categories that got this "poor" rating were bridges, roads and drinking water.	O	O
This translates into an extra 7 billion hours that harassed drivers must spend on the road, according to data from the American Automobile Association (AAA), along with 3 billion gallons of gas wasted by idling engines and a total of $160 billion in total losses each year.	O	O
"(We) are paying a steep price due to potholes and bad road conditions," said Michael Green, a spokesperson for AAA.	O	O
Some experts say the estimated $32 billion yearly that the tax could bring in wouldn't even come close to fixing the problem.	O	O
But to make matters worse, much of the money would never be used for the roads and would instead be spent on a grocery list of projects that "accelerate the integration of autonomous vehicles, low-carbon technologies and intelligent transportation systems into our infrastructure," according to the proposed budget.	O	O
The proposal would also use 15 percent of the oil fee revenues to provide assistance to low- and moderate-income families facing higher costs from the transition to cleaner energy.	O	O
That's a social rather than economic goal unlikely to sit well with Republicans complaining about the budget deficit.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
While The Atlantic magazine called the plan "Obama's $10 Oil-Tax Pipe Dream," others said it was ingeniously designed to collect revenue while deflecting criticism away from the administration.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
"By applying it to the oil companies, you let them be the monsters," said GasBuddy's DeHaan.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
Since the $10.25 a barrel tax would represent about a third of the current price of oil, oil companies would pass the increase along to consumers "as quickly as the tax is approved," according to Luana Siegfried, an energy analyst associate with Raymond James.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
The oil industry -- rather than the government -- would then face the brunt of consumer anger.	O	O
With oil prices down sharply, oil companies would be hard-pressed not to pass the tax along.	O	O
The U.S. oil industry faces a "gloomy outlook," according to Paul O'Donnell of IHS, which provides research on the energy markets.	O	O
It could see "forced asset sales at bargain prices, sizable staff layoffs and, in the worst cases, bankruptcies.	O	O
"Many experts agree that while the nation needs more taxes to help patch its roads, particularly since the federal gas tax hasn't budged in 22 years, a tax on crude isn't the way to go.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax

It could be based on inflation, suggests Avery Ash, director of federal relations for the AAA, because more money is needed as construction costs rise.	B	oil tax
Or it could work inversely to the price of gasoline, which would minimize the pain for consumers, since a higher price for gas would lower the tax, and drivers would pay a higher tax as the base cost of gasoline went down.	I	oil tax

Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
President Obama wants to impose a huge new oil tax.	O	O
The White House on Thursday proposed a wave of clean transportation investments that would be paid for through a $10-per-barrel fee on oil.	O	O
-which is very unlikely to get through Republican-controlled Congress -- would be paid for by oil companies.	O	O
It also comes at a time when the energy industry has been crushed by the dramatic crash in oil prices.	O	O
Jeffrey Zients, Obama's chief economic adviser, told reporters the fee would apply to oil that is imported into the U.S.	O	O
He said oil pumped in the U.S. that is exported would not be taxed, ensuring a "level playing field" for American producers.	O	O
The U.S. imports quite a lot oil even though it has become more self-reliant in recent years.	O	O
The nation imported 7.4 million barrels of oil per day as of November, down from 10 million at the end of 2005, according to the Energy Information Administration.	O	O
By comparison, the U.S. pumped 9.3 million barrels of oil and exported just 320,000 barrels per day in November.	O	O
It's not clear exactly where along the production chain the fee would be levied or whether it would be imposed on American oil that is not exported.	O	O
Zients did say it wouldn't be imposed at the wellhead.	O	O
Obama wants the new revenue to pay for an upgrade to the country's transportation system.	B	$10-a-barrel oil tax
The plan calls for boosting spending on clean transportation infrastructure by 50% and includes integrating new technology like self-driving cars.	O	O
"Our transportation system is too dependent on oil.	O	O
The system was not designed to handle the realities of changing climate," Zients said.	O	O
The White House said the new tax would encourage clean energy innovation and reduce the country's reliance on oil.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
The proposal aims to expand transit systems in cities, make high-speed rail more of an alternative to flying and modernize freight systems.	I	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
The oil fee would also provide for the "long-term solvency" of the Highway Trust Fund, a dwindling pool of money that helps finance projects such as maintaining the country's roads and bridges.	I	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
Republicans in Congress are extremely unlikely to support the tax.	O	O
House Speaker Paul Ryan quickly called the tax "dead on arrival in Congress" and warned it would hurt poor Americans by raising energy prices.	B	$10-a-barrel oil tax
"It really has no chance," said Joe McMonigle, a senior energy analyst at Potomac Research Group who previously served as chief of staff at the Energy Department.	B	$10-a-barrel oil tax
The proposal comes at a very difficult time for the oil industry.	O	O
Almost all oil companies have cut jobs, many have filed for bankruptcy and others have defaulted on their loans.	O	O
Even the biggest oil companies have posted huge drops in profits and slashed plans to invest in their business expansion.	O	O
The oil industry wasted little time voicing its opposition, warning that such a tax would raise the cost of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon and killing American jobs.	B	$10-a-barrel oil tax
"On his way out of office, President Obama has now proposed making the United States less competitive," Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Industry, wrote in a statement.	O	O
The White House acknowledged that oil companies would "likely" pass on "some" costs to consumers.	O	O
However, it stressed that the current infrastructure system has costs as well.	O	O
"We have to tackle problems that have been simmering for decades," Zients said.	O	O
"No one is arguing about the challenges.	O	O
No one wants to talk about how to pay for it.".	O	O

The new tax would be phased in over five years, and would apply to both domestic and imported oil.	O	O
"This is a per-barrel fee on oil paid for by oil companies," White House economic adviser Jeff Zients told reporters Thursday.	O	O
"So they're the ones paying the fee.	O	O
We recognize that oil companies will likely pass on some of these costs.	O	O
"Although the tax is likely to run into political opposition from Republicans, it comes at the most politically expedient time possible: Rock-bottom oil prices could make the inevitable increase in gas prices that would follow a tax increase more palatable.	B	$10-a-barrel oil tax
"Something like this would trickle down and be a $10 per barrel tax on motorists," DeHaan said.	O	O
"This is not something oil companies are going to absorb.	B	$10-a-barrel oil tax
"That means a 15-gallon fill-up would cost at least $2.76 more per day.	I	$10-a-barrel oil tax
It would also affect people who use heating oil to warm their homes and diesel to fill their trucks.	I	$10-a-barrel oil tax
But Obama will also propose a relief fund for families affected by higher energy bills.	O	O
Of course, at a nationwide average of $1.77 per gallon on Thursday, gasoline is already cheap compared to historic highs.	O	O
Environmentalists say a small price increase is worth it to help fight climate change and spur innovation.	O	O
Zients declined to elaborate on how the oil fee -- which is different from a gas tax -- would affect prices at the pump.	O	O
DeHaan called it a "bold" proposal that would be the most significant change in energy policy in recent memory.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
Oil stock investors did not appear to be fazed when the news hit Thursday afternoon.	O	O

CREDIT: AP PHOTO/CAROLYN KASTERPresident Obama’s budget request next week will include plans for a $35-billion-per-year clean transportation plan, funded by a $10 per barrel tax on oil, phased in over five years.	O	O
In a fact sheet about the president’s “21st Century Clean Transportation System,” the White House detailed how this new fee on the oil industry would boost federal funding for clean transportation by 50 percent, and help create “hundreds of thousands of good-paying, middle-class jobs each year.	O	O
”The priority would be to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which is responsible for nearly a third of U.S. emissions.	O	O
Last year, Congress did pass a transportation bill, though the White House called it “merely a first step towards what our economy needs, with only a modest increase in infrastructure funding.	O	O
”Theoretically, this is an excellent time to raise fees on oil, with the global glut causing the price of Brent crude to fall below $30 per barrel at the end of last year, and Wall Street not predicting that to change much any time soon.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
As American economic growth continues to grow while decoupling from energy consumption, proposals like these become more feasible.	I	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
The fee would help provide the long-term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund, and provides an incentive to cut oil consumption and boost clean energy investment.	B	$10-a-barrel oil tax
The plan would invest in clean vehicle research and deployment, including electric vehicle (EV) charging systems and clean autonomous vehicles.	O	O
“This proposal, if enacted, would generate substantial and sustainable new revenue to transform our transportation sector and cut carbon pollution,” said Greg Dotson, vice president for energy policy at the Center for American Progress.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
Because Americans waste 7 billion hours in traffic each year, the plan boosts funding for mass transit options like rail and public transit by $20 billion per year.	O	O
This includes suburbs and rural areas, high-speed rail, and a modern freight rail system.	O	O
The plan would also provide bonus funding — to the tune of $10 billion per year — to state and local governments that use existing transportation funding to cut carbon pollution, “for example by encouraging better land use planning, investing in clean vehicle fueling infrastructure or increasing use of public transportation.	O	O
”Clean autonomous vehicles and other next-generation transportation systems would get $2 billion per year in research and development, clean vehicle fleet upgrades, and regional fueling infrastructure for low-carbon vehicles.	O	O
The fact sheet identified cutting carbon pollution and strengthening the economy as primary goals.	O	O
“A key step in that effort is making smart and strategic investments to create a cleaner, more sustainable transportation system,” it read.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
Environmental groups lauded the move, with Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune pointing out that, following the historic Paris climate agreement, this move shows how “President Obama laid out more of his vision of how we can meet this agreement by challenging Big Oil’s stranglehold on how America powers its transportation sector.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
”The plan, part of the administration’s yearly budget proposal, would have to go through a Republican-controlled congress hostile to the president’s energy and environmental initiatives.	O	O

B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
”The oil industry may be in a downturn due to the fact that it is producing too much, but the biggest companies are still pulling in hundreds of billions of dollars a year in revenues, benefiting from tens of billions in energy subsidies per year in the United States alone.	O	O
“For over a century, oil, gas and coal companies got rich by foisting onto us the massive health and environmental costs of burning and extracting fossil fuels,” Elijah Zarlin, director of Climate Campaigns at CREDO Action, said in a statement.	O	O
“The new oil fee in President Obama’s budget is a welcome step to make oil companies begin to pay a small part of the societal cost of their product — but it is unfortunate that it will likely be blocked by Republicans in Congress that are beholden to those oil companies, not the best interests of the American people.	B	$10-a-barrel oil tax
”The president first moved to address carbon pollution in the transportation sector in 2009 with the American Recovery and Re-investment Act to help pull the country out of recession by using loans at historically low interest rates to pay for research, mass transit, high-speed rail, and road and bridge modernization upgrades in thousands of cities and towns.

Republicans savage Obama's oil tax plan
Republicans and the oil industry teed off on President Obama and his plan announced on Thursday to impose a $10 tax on every barrel of crude oil to pay for green transportation projects.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
The GOP outrage that greeted Obama's plan, first reported by POLITICO ahead of its release in next week's White House budget, showed the tax would get no traction in Congress — and it gave Republicans a platform to blast the president's environmental agenda as bad for the economy.	I	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
"This horrible idea is a waste of time that will never see the light of day," House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said through a spokeswoman.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
"Hammering the pocketbooks of every American while killing good-paying energy jobs — no wonder the economy is in such trouble.	I	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
"Both House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.	O	O
) declared the president's plan "dead on arrival," and a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, challenged Democrats to defend the tax plan.	O	O
"We look forward to seeing whether or not Senate Democrats will support this massive gas tax on American families, farmers and employers," McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said by email.	O	O
The proposal also looked likely to drive a wedge between the Democratic establishment and the party's left wing, which has been emboldened by its success in pressuring Obama to reject the Keystone XL pipeline and a imposing new moratorium on federal coal mining leases.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
But so far, Democrats remained largely silent on the oil-tax proposal that landed after Congress adjourned for the week.	O	O
Neither Hillary Clinton's nor Bernie Sanders' campaigns returned requests for comment, but environmentalists who are facing an increasingly tough choice between Clinton and Sanders heaped praise upon Obama's outline for a fee on the 19 million barrels of oil used every day in the U.S.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
“President Obama’s vision underscores the inevitable transition away from oil,” said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, who hailed the White House for “challenging Big Oil’s stranglehold on how America powers its transportation sector.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
”Representatives of Donald Trump and Sens.	O	O
Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, the three leading GOP presidential contenders, did not immediately return requests for comment on the oil tax.	O	O
The president's planned oil fee would help fund nearly $20 billion a year in new investments in transit, high-speed rail, and other climate-friendly transportation projects, according to a White House summary of the proposal.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
The remainder of money spent on new infrastructure would come from a one-time tax on foreign earnings that Obama included in his budget last year, another proposal that went nowhere in Congress.	O	O
Jeff Zients, director of Obama's National Economic Council, told reporters Thursday that the White House is aware "oil companies will pass on some of these costs" to consumers.	O	O
The phased-in tax would apply to imported oil and oil consumed in the country, but not on newly allowed exports of U.S. crude, which Zients aid "avoids putting U.S. product at a competitive disadvantage" overseas.	O	O
Pressed to describe where and how the proposed tax would be applied, Zients said only that "we look forward to working on the details with Congress.	O	O
"The oil industry dismissed the proposal in withering terms.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
“On his way out of office, President Obama has now proposed making the United States less competitive," American Petroleum Institute CEO Jack Gerard said in a statement, echoing rough projections that the fee would add about 25 cents to the per-gallon cost of gasoline.	O	O
"The fee is nothing but a hidden gas tax imposed on domestic consumers," said Stephen Brown, a vice president at the refining company Tesoro.	B	$10-a-barrel oil tax
Despite including imported foreign oil, he added by email, "its legality under existing bi- and multi-lateral trade agreements remains a concern.	I	$10-a-barrel oil tax
"Still, with oil prices hovering near their lowest levels in a decade, now is a convenient time for Obama to touch the third rail of American politics and pitch an energy tax.	O	O
Oil prices have sunk by nearly 75 percent since mid-2014, and the average U.S. price at the pump is now lower than the $1.89 per gallon Americans paid during Obama's first inauguration.	O	O

The Obama administration on Thursday proposed a $10-per-barrel tax on oil companies to fund alternative transportation efforts.
The Obama administration is proposing a $10-per-barrel tax on oil companies to fund hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of alternative transportation efforts, part of President Barack Obama’s ambitious climate agenda.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
The tax, which would bring in roughly $32 billion a year from companies producing oil, is part of the administration’s broader budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2017.	O	O
The administration is scheduled to release that proposal Tuesday, and it would requires congressional approval.	O	O
With crude oil price hovering near $30 a barrel, the levy would amount to a tax of 30% unless and until oil prices rise again.	O	O
The Republican-controlled Congress is almost certain not to incorporate the proposal into the spending bills that actually fund the government.	O	O
GOP leaders are likely to oppose any new tax on energy companies, and virtually any new tax at all.	O	O
“The House will kill this absurd proposal, and instead focus on lowering costs and growing our economy,” said House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
).	O	O
Nonetheless, the Obama administration’s proposal to tax oil companies carries political significance, reflecting the increased focus Mr. Obama’s White House is putting on climate change in the president’s last years in office.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
Other parts of the administration, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, have pursued expansive regulations cutting down on the emissions that scientists blame for climate change, including carbon dioxide and methane.	O	O
Related CoverageEnvironmental groups praised Mr. Obama’s proposal Thursday.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
“With today’s announcement, President Obama laid out more of his vision of how we can meet this agreement by challenging Big Oil’s stranglehold on how America powers its transportation sector,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
Mr. Obama’s proposal to tax oil companies also could inject the contentious topic onto the presidential campaign trail once again.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
Republican candidates are vowing to repeal Mr. Obama’s environmental agenda, while both Democratic candidates have called for more aggressive climate policies than Mr. Obama is pursuing.	B	Obama proposes $10-a-barrel oil tax
The tax proposal, which the administration describes as a fee, would apply to crude oil and pay for a range of alternative transportation efforts, including mass transit and cleaner transportation options.	O	O
During a conference call Thursday, White House officials didn't offer many additional details about the proposal.	O	O
The tax, which would be phased in over five years, wouldn't be levied on companies at the wells where they produce oil, according to Jeff Zients, director of the White House’s National Economic Council.	O	O
“We look forward to working on the details with Congress,” Mr. Zients, said, repeatedly declining to answer questions about what part of the production and transportation process of the oil industry companies would pay the fee.	O	O
The tax would also help fund the Highway Trust Fund, whose solvency has dwindled in recent years because it is funded by a gasoline tax of 18.4 cents per gallon that hasn’t been raised in nearly 25 years.	B	$10-a-barrel oil tax
Mr. Zients said an oil tax is more equitable across the transportation landscape.	O	O
“Our transportation system is much bigger than our highways and transit system,” said Mr. Zients.	O	O
“An oil fee means that users across the transportation [sector] fund new investment.	B	oil tax
”Oil prices, have recently dropped to levels not seen in more than a decade.	O	O
Some political experts argue that low oil prices provide the best opportunity to impose new taxes on the fuel.	O	O
But oil companies and oil-state lawmakers from both parties are likely to be at least as opposed to the idea as they would be otherwise, given that the industry is hurting from cheap oil.	O	O

Samsung trips on quality control in rush to pip Apple
In its rush to beat rival products to market, notably Apple’s (AAPL.O) new iPhone, Samsung Electronics (005930.	O	O
KS) has accelerated new phone launch cycles, but its haste is raising concerns that it fell short on quality testing.	O	O
A Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone is held next to a logo of Apple in this September 23, 2014 illustration photo in Sarajevo.	O	O
REUTERS/Dado RuvicSince last year, the South Korean firm, the world’s largest maker of smartphones, has brought forward the launch of its Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series models by roughly a month.	O	O
For the June quarter, the strategy helped Samsung to its best profit in more than two years, but it is also putting strain on its supply chain and its manufacturing reputation.	O	O
On Friday, two weeks after launch, Samsung recalled Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in 10 markets including South Korea and the United States after finding its batteries were prone to ignite, and halted sales of the 988,900 won ($891) device in those markets indefinitely.	O	O
The recall looks set to hamstring a revival in Samsung’s mobile business just as Apple gears up to launch its new iPhones this month.	B	Samsung suspends all sales of Galaxy Note 7
“Samsung might have over-exerted itself trying to pre-empt Apple, since everybody knows the iPhones launch in September,” said Chang Sea-Jin, business professor at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and author of “Sony vs.	B	Samsung
Samsung”, a history of the electronics giants.	I	Samsung
“It’s an unfortunate event; it feels like Samsung rushed a bit, and it’s possible that this led to suppliers also being hurried.	I	Samsung
”Samsung said in a statement to Reuters it conducts “extensive preparation” for its products and will release them to the market “only after proper completion of the development process”.	O	O
The firm said on Friday it had identified a problem in the manufacturing process of a battery supplier it didn’t name.	O	O
“I am working to straighten out our quality control process,” Samsung’s mobile business chief Koh Dong-jin said then.	O	O
The scale of the unprecedented recall, which some analysts forecast will cost Samsung nearly $5 billion in revenue this year, follows a separate supply-chain management issue that led to disappointing sales of the Galaxy S6 series last year.	B	Samsung
Samsung executives said production problems for the curved screens and metal casings used in the Galaxy S6 edge led to a supply shortage for the device, leaving the firm unable to capitalize on the critical acclaim the phone received, sapping earnings momentum.	O	O
GETTING AHEAD Counterpoint analyst Jeff Fieldhack said Samsung stole the thunder from local rival LG Electronics’ (066570.	B	Samsung
KS) launch of the G5 smartphone this year by starting the sales of the Galaxy S7 smartphones a month earlier and backing them with an aggressive marketing campaign.	I	Samsung
“I believe they were trying to create a similar effect by beating Apple to market by (about) a month, too,” he said.	I	Samsung
“Very often, lab times and testing periods are shrunk to expedite approval and time-to-market of key devices.	I	Samsung
It is possible all charging scenarios were not thoroughly tested.	I	Samsung
”Samsung SDI, one of two makers of batteries for the Note 7 - the other has not been identified - said it had not received notice from Samsung Electronics regarding its batteries and declined to comment further, including whether its batteries were found to be faulty.	O	O
The company declined to comment on a local media report that it had production difficulties and struggled to meet orders in time.	O	O
While there are occasional reports of phones catching fire or burning users, recalls for such problems are rare.	O	O
The problem is exacerbated by the fact that batteries in the Galaxy Note 7 can not be removed by the user - a design decision to make the phones slimmer and waterproof.	O	O
A Samsung executive who declined to be named told Reuters before the recall announcement: “Our production engineers and managers are extremely experienced, and if you ask them to find a solution to adopt a design change, they’d promptly bring things under control.	O	O
“But even that capability is under growing strain, as we try out new materials and everything is on a very tight schedule.	O	O
”Local brokerage Korea Investment cut its third-quarter operating profit forecast for Samsung by 1.1 trillion won to 7.1 trillion won due to the recall, though it said the event would not derail the broader rebound of its smartphone business.	B	Samsung
If haste contributed to the problem, it could now help Samsung limit the impact of the recall.	B	Samsung
Shares in Samsung were up 0.8 percent in mid-day trade on Tuesday, 4.4 percent below record highs reached two weeks ago, as some investors welcomed the swift decision to launch a global recall.	O	O

The warning came a week after Samsung ordered a global recall of the phones.	O	O
In some cases, the device’s lithium batteries sparked fires, including one that destroyed a Jeep in St.	O	O
Petersburg, Fla.	O	O
Samsung asked all owners to return the phones that began circulating in August.	O	O
The offer was to exchange the phones for a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge, along with a $25 gift certificate for the inconvenience.	O	O
“We are offering this exchange because your safety and peace of mind is our top priority,” the company said last week.	O	O
Rechargeable lithium batteries are widely used in electronic devices because they are lighter and are smaller than other comparable batteries.	O	O
But the batteries are also susceptible to overheating when damaged or suffering from manufacturing problems.	O	O
Larger lithium batteries sparked problems for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, after batteries short-circuited and damaged planes in Boston and Japan.	O	O
The fleet of new planes was grounded worldwide for three months in early 2013 as Boeing developed and installed safeguards against the batteries overheating.	O	O

Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 should be officially recalled \u2013 US consumer watchdog
US product safety and testing non-profit organisation Consumer Reports has called for Samsung to initiate an official recall of all of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, following a halt in sales caused by some phablets exploding while charging.	B	Samsung
Samsung suspended sales of its new flagship smartphone on Friday, the day of its official launch in the UK, after 35 confirmed explosions led to a fault being identified within batteries supplied by one of a few companies used in the Note 7.	O	O
The top-end phablet had already gone on sale in South Korea and the US, with Samsung having sold 1m of them and made a total of 2.5m.	O	O
But the company stopped short of initiating a full recall, saying that it would “voluntarily replace their current device with a new one over the coming weeks”.	O	O
Galaxy Note 7 sales suspended over battery explosions, Samsung boss announces – video “Samsung should immediately initiate an official recall with the Consumer Product Safety Commission given the serious nature of the safety problem it identified with the Galaxy Note7,” said Maria Rerecich, Consumer Reports director of electronics testing.	B	Samsung
Consumer Reports discovered that despite a halt in sales from Samsung, some retailers were still offering the phone for sale.	O	O
It also contacted the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), which analyses reported faults and determines if corrective action is required, including a full-scale recall, and found that no such action had been taken by Samsung on Friday.	O	O
A full recall under CPSC would require the return of all smartphones sold and an immediate halt of sales from all retail outlets, not just from the manufacturer.	O	O
While recalls of consumer electronics and other products are quite common, affecting almost all major manufacturers including Apple, this is the largest-scale product defect Samsung has had in recent memory.	O	O
The Note 7’s defects come on the eve of arch rival Apple’s unveiling of its next iPhone, and will likely set the availability of the Samsung device back at least two weeks.	O	O
Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung’s mobile business, said: “I can’t comment on exactly how much the cost will be, but it pains my heart that it will be such a big number.	B	Samsung suspends all sales of Galaxy Note 7
”The Note 7’s defects come on the eve of arch rival Apple’s unveiling of its next iPhone, and will likely set the availability of the Samsung device back at least two weeks, possibly denting consumer appetite for the 5.7in smartphone.	O	O
While the issues with the Note 7 are certainly embarrassing, industry sources say that should the company be able to rectify the issues with the phablet, the launch delay and product swap is manageable.	B	Galaxy Note 7
The Note 7 is a high-profile device for Samsung, but its sales are likely to be a fraction of those generated by the company’s smaller and cheaper top-end devices the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones.	O	O

Samsung recalls Galaxy Note 7 phones after battery fires
Samsung has recalled its new Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in 10 countries after reports that some batteries exploded or caught fire.	O	O
Koh Dong-jin, head of the South Korean company’s smartphone business, expressed regret over the recall of an estimated 1m devices, which will affect markets including South Korea, the United States and Australia.	B	Galaxy Note 7
The phone was due to launch in the UK on Friday but Samsung said sales had been stopped because of a “battery cell issue”.	O	O
Reports began circulating on social media during the week that the phone was catching fire when charging.	O	O
Samsung would not confirm if the problems happened while the phones were charging or during normal use.	O	O
The recall comes just over two weeks after the company launched its latest premium phone, which features an outsized screen and high-resolution camera.	O	O
Koh, who declined to comment on how many phones needed to be replaced, said Samsung had sold 2.5m of the devices so far.	O	O
The manufacturer plans to replace not only phones with faulty batteries sold to consumers, but also retailer inventories and units in transit.	O	O
Nomura estimated that more than 1m units have been sold to end consumers.	O	O
“I can’t comment on exactly how much the cost will be, but it pains my heart that it will be such a big number,” Koh said.	B	Samsung
Models in China feature a different battery and are not being recalled by Samsung, the world’s biggest smartphone vendor.	O	O
The scale of the recall is unprecedented for Samsung, which prides itself on its manufacturing prowess.	O	O
While recalls in the smartphone industry do happen, including for rival Apple, the nature of the problem for the Galaxy Note 7 is a serious blow to Samsung’s reputation, analysts said.	B	Galaxy Note 7
Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review: the king of the phablets returns	O	O
The company should act quickly to minimise damage to its smartphone recovery, after a string of product successes had reversed a fall in market share, they added.	B	Samsung
The phone first launched in 10 markets in North America, Asia and the Middle East.	O	O
Further roll-outs have occurred since in markets like China, where sales started just this week.	O	O
Its wider availability, including this weekend in the UK, is now on hold.	O	O
While there are occasional reports of phones catching fire or otherwise burning users, documented cases that lead to widespread product recalls remain relatively rare.	O	O
Samsung said it was aware of 35 reports of affected Note 7 batteries.	O	O
In 2007, the largest battery recall in consumer electronics history took place when Nokia, then the world’s top mobile handset maker, offered to replace 46m phone batteries produced for it by Japanese maker Matsushita Battery.	O	O
Germany’s biggest operator, Deutsche Telekom, said it had stopped delivering orders for the Galaxy Note 7, while French operator Orange said on its website that it had stopped pre-sales of the phone and postponed its planned sales launch –scheduled for Friday.	O	O
In Britain, mobile carriers EE and Vodafone continue to accept pre-orders for the Note 7 on their sites.	O	O
US operators have been taking pre-orders since early August.	O	O
All major wireless carriers, including top US wireless provider Verizon Communications, said they had stopped selling the Galaxy Note 7.	O	O
Target, a major U.S. retailer, also said it had halted sales of the Note 7.	O	O
Verizon said that if a customer wants to return or exchange the Galaxy Note 7, it would waive through September 30 the restocking fee it charges customers.	O	O
T-Mobile US, majority owned by Deutsche Telekom, said in a statement it would also waive restocking and shipping charges to customers who want to return the recalled phone.	O	O
Samsung has said it aimed for the Note 7 to maintain strong sales momentum in the second half of the year against stiffening competition from the likes of Apple, which is widely expected to release its latest iPhone next week.	O	O
“I am concerned more about a potential reduction in sales than recall costs,” said analyst Jay Yoo at Korea Investment & Securities.	O	O
“The recall is likely to be a blow to earnings.	O	O
”Samsung said new sales of the Note 7 in affected markets would resume after it deals with replacements, a process it expects will begin in about two weeks.	O	O
The firm would extend refund periods for affected customers and offer exchanges for other Samsung phones, Koh said.	O	O
Investors sold Samsung shares after the delay announcement on Thursday, stripping about $7bn from the firm’s market value, which remains just off recent record highs.	O	O

INDYTechSamsung Galaxy Note 7: Flagship phone that spontaneously explodes to be globally recalled, reports sayOne of the various pictures of exploded phones that are circulating online /Samsung is about to take the entirely unprecedented step of recalling all of its flagship phones, just after they went on sale, according to reports.	O	O
Reports that the Galaxy Note 7 are exploding as they are charged mean that the company is about to issue a global recall of the phone as soon as this weekend, according to local reports.	O	O
Investigations into numerous incidences of the phones blowing up while they charged have shown that the batteries were at fault, South Korea’s Yonhap News reported.	O	O
Shipments of the phone have already been delayed, in part to allow them to undergo extra quality control testing.	O	O
The Galaxy Note 7 was launched just two weeks ago as Samsung’s new flagship phone.	O	O
The company had hoped that it would take on the iPhone 7 aud its Plus version, both of which are set to be launched next week.	O	O
Citing an unnamed official, Yonhap said that Samsung’s investigation had found that the faulty batteries led to the phones catching on fire.	O	O
Numerous social media reports have shown the phones exploding while they were plugged in, and pictures and videos of severely damaged phones are being shared online.	O	O
There haven’t been any confirmed injuries from the problems.	O	O
Samsung hasn’t commented on the report.	O	O
But it said that it was working with its partners to inspect the parts and that it would publicise the findings when it is completed.	O	O
"We will share the findings as soon as possible,” a representative said.	O	O
“Samsung is fully committed to providing the highest quality products to our consumers.	B	Samsung
”The problem is limited to “less than 0.01 per cent” of the phones on the market, according to the Yonhap report.	O	O
It is looking into how it can resolve the issue with its network partners, the report claimed.	O	O
Despite the ongoing investigation and reports of the recall, Samsung launched the new phone in China this week.	O	O
It didn’t say whether those phones were safe from the problem and whether they are different from the ones being sold in South Korea, where the explosions have been reported.	O	O
The new phone had been hoped to continue the recovery of Samsung’s phone business, which has faced difficulties in recent years.	O	O
It came as the company seemed to be recovering, reporting stellar earnings this quarter and bringing its share price to a record high – before it came tumbling back down on the new reports.	O	O
The phone had already run into problems since the release, as supplies were failing to keep up with the higher-than-expected demand for the phone.	O	O
The Note 7 is Samsung’s top of the line phone, serving as its flagship and demonstrating its most significant technologies.	O	O
The headline feature of the new phone had been an iris scanner, which lets people unlock the phone with their eyes.	O	O

Samsung last week began a global recall for the phone, just two weeks after its launch, because of the risk of them catching fire or exploding.	O	O
At the time, Samsung said it had confirmed 35 instances of the problem, out of 2.5 million phones sold.	O	O
The company did not say last week whether users should stop using the phones, and said new phones would be available in about two weeks.	O	O
But in a statement Friday, Samsung Electronics America asked Note 7 owners to shut off their phones and exchange them now for another device.	O	O
The company says new Note 7 phones will not be available until after the CPSC finishes its “process”, but owners can exchange the Note 7s now for a different model.	O	O
US aviation safety officials also on Thursday took the unusual step of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge the phone during flights, or put them in checked bags.	O	O
The recall comes at a crucial time for Samsung, as its rival Apple just announced its own latest versions of the iPhone.	O	O

A customer holds a Samsung Electronics Galaxy Note 7 smartphone at the headquarters of South Korean mobile carrier KT in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, Sept. 2, 2016. Samsung will issue a global recall of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone as soon as this weekend after its investigation on explosion claims found batteries were at fault, according to South Korea's Yonhap News. (AP Photo/ahn Young-joon)
Samsung's Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from iPhones to Tesla cars to Boeing jetliners.	O	O
Blame chemistry and the fact that the batteries we rely on for everyday life are prone to leaking and even bursting into flame if damaged, defective or exposed to excessive heat.	O	O
That's because lithium-ion batteries store a lot of energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls.	O	O
If something happens to those separators, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control.	O	O
Samsung hasn't specified exactly what caused the fires that led to the recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s Thursday beyond calling it a "battery cell issue.	O	O

Samsung will issue a global recall of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone as soon as this weekend after its investigation on explosion claims found batteries were at fault, according to South Korea's Yonhap News.	O	O
(AP Photo/ahn Young-joon)Still, lithium batteries are so ubiquitous that ordinary users of phones and computers shouldn't worry.	O	O
Research suggests that you're more likely to get hurt by a kitchen grease fire or a drunk driver than the battery powering your iPhone, Kindle or laptop.	O	O
"It's not like we live in a world where people's smartphones spontaneously combust," said Ramon Llamas, research manager of research firm IDC's mobile phones team.	O	O
He said owners of Galaxy Note 7s should err on the side of caution and contact Samsung for a replacement that doesn't run the same risk.	B	Galaxy Note 7
Here's a look at other notable incidents when lithium batteries by themselves or in electronics have caused problems.	O	O
ON AIRPLANESThere have been dozens of aircraft fires caused by lithium batteries, so many that the batteries are no longer welcome as cargo on passenger flights.	O	O
In one of the most recent incidents, a Fiji Airways Boeing 737 was preparing for takeoff from Melbourne, Australia, when smoke was discovered coming from the cargo bay.	O	O
The plane was evacuated and the cargo unloaded.	O	O
The source of the fire turned out to be lithium-ion batteries in a passenger's checked bags.	O	O
Hoverboards and e-cigarettes are banned from flights for the same reason.	O	O
TESLAIn August, a Tesla electric car caught fire during a promotional tour in southwest France.	O	O
Tesla said in a statement that it is "working with the authorities to establish the facts" about the fire.	O	O
The driver was quoted in local newspaper Sud Ouest as saying he answered a Facebook ad offering test drives of the Model S sedan.	O	O
The driver said he saw smoke, and the three people aboard got out before seeing it catch fire.	O	O
Tesla hasn't officially found fault with the battery.	O	O
But in 2013 , it faced questions when several Model S sedans caught fire after road debris damaged their batteries.	O	O
Tesla wound up strengthening the battery shield on new and existing cars.	O	O
HOVERBOARDSHoverboards, or self-balancing scooters, have been linked with at least 99 electrical fires in the U.S., according to the the Consumer Product Safety Commission.	O	O
Hoverboards might be more susceptible than other products to battery fires because they come under more duress than other electronic devices like computers.	O	O
Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers dumped the products after videos of burning hoverboards went viral.	O	O
But they reopened sales this year after passing new fire-safety tests.	O	O
COMPUTER BATTERIESIn June HP recalled nearly 50,000 HP, Compaq, HP ProBook, HP ENVY, Compaq Presario, and HP Pavilion computers after seven reports of battery packs overheating, melting or charring, including four reports of property damage totaling about $4,000.	O	O

Samsung offers cash incentives to Galaxy Note 7 customers after exploding battery kerfuffle
Samsung is reportedly offering people who bought its Galaxy Note 7 cash incentives to stick with the brand, rather than exchange it for a rival smartphone maker's device.	O	O
Samsung's US subsidiary said on Friday that it will offer customers a $25 credit if they exchange their Galaxy Note 7 for another Samsung smartphone, rather than get a refund.	O	O
Customers can swap their phone for a Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge or a replacement Galaxy Note 7 in exchange for $25, in the form of a gift card or bill credit, according to Recode.	O	O
Samsung told the website it expects to have replacement Galaxy Note 7 devices as soon as next week.	O	O
Those who choose a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge will also get a refund of any difference in price.	O	O
“Samsung is taking a proactive approach to address customer needs around the Note 7,” Samsung Electronics America President Tim Baxter said in a statement.	B	Samsung
The safety and satisfaction of our customers is Samsung’s top priority.	I	Samsung
”There is no word yet on whether people who pre-ordered the handset in the UK will be offered the same incentive.	O	O
The move comes after Samsung was forced to halt sales of its Galaxy Note 7 just two weeks after the flagship smartphone went on sale, after some customers reported that batteries in the gadgets had caught fire and exploded while they were charging.	O	O
Samsung said it had sold 1 million Galaxy Note handsets in South Korea and the US before the sales suspension, and that it had confirmed 35 cases of battery issues.	O	O
Although the company has two battery suppliers, it has not found a way to specify which phones may endanger users, so if offering to exchange all of them.	O	O
"There was a tiny problem in the manufacturing process so it was very difficult to find out," said Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung's mobile business.	O	O
Galaxy Note 7s were pulled from shelves in 10 countries.	O	O
The smartphone was due to go on sale in the UK on Friday, but the launch was suspended and advertising pulled from the websites of mobile operators following the reports.	O	O
Now US product safety and testing non-profit organisation Consumer Reports has called for Samsung to officially recall of all of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, citing the "serious nature of the safety problem".	O	O
A full recall would require the return of all smartphones sold, and an immediate halt of sales from all retailers and mobile operators - not just Samsung itself.	O	O
"I can't comment on exactly how much the cost will be, but it pains my heart that it will be such a big number," said Koh Dong-jin.	B	Samsung suspends all sales of Galaxy Note 7

Samsung stops ALL sales of Galaxy Note 7 after reports of replacement phones catching fire
Samsung has halted all sales of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after new reports of phones catching fire.	O	O
The company suspended production of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, a source said on Monday, after reports of fires in replacement devices added to the tech giant's worst ever recall crisis.	O	O
But it seems there have since been more reports of replacement phones catching fire.	O	O
Samsung also told owners to stop using it and power it down while it investigated the fault.	O	O
"We are working with relevant regulatory bodies to investigate the recently reported cases involving the Galaxy Note 7," the company said in a statement.	O	O
Top US and Australian mobile operators also suspended sales or exchanges of Note 7 s, while major airlines reiterated bans on passengers using the phones, after smoke from a replacement device forced the evacuation of a passenger plane in the United States last week.	O	O
Fires in phones that were meant to replace devices that had been recalled because of their propensity to explode would be a disaster for the world's largest smartphone maker, suggesting it has failed to fix a problem that has already hurt its brand and threatens to derail a recovery in its mobile business.	O	O
"If the Note 7 is allowed to continue it could lead to the single greatest act of brand self-destruction in the history of modern technology," said Eric Schiffer, brand strategy expert chairman of Reputation Management Consultants.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
"Samsung needs to take a giant write-down and cast the Note 7 to the engineering hall of shame next to the Ford Pinto.	O	O
"In a regulatory filing, Samsung said it was "adjusting" shipments of Note 7s to allow for inspections and stronger quality control due to some devices catching fire.	O	O
It did not comment on the production halt or the cause of the fires.	O	O
Samsung said it was investigating reports of "heat damage issues" and would take immediate action to fix any problems in line with measures approved by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.	O	O
On September 2, Samsung announced a global recall of 2.5 million Note 7s due to faulty batteries which caused some of the phones to catch fire.	O	O
It ordered new batteries from another supplier and started shipping replacements to customers just two weeks later.	O	O
But similar problems arose with a replacement Note 7 on October 5, which began smoking inside a Southwest Airline flight in the United States.	O	O
Samsung shares, which have rebounded after an initial sell-off on the recall, closed down 1.5%, compared with a 0.2% rise for the broader market.	O	O
"I think the cleanest thing to do is to give up on the Note 7," said HDC Asset Management fund manager Park Jung-hoon, whose fund owns Samsung shares.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
"What's scary is that this is causing people to repeatedly doubt Samsung's fundamental capabilities, so it's important for Samsung to get past this issue quickly.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
"Samsung's recall crisis has coincided with pressure from one of the world's most aggressive hedge funds, Elliott Management, to split the company and pay out $27 billion in a special dividend.	O	O
Major airlines, air regulators and airport authorities reiterated bans on passengers using the phones , saying Note 7s should not be powered up or charged on board.	O	O
A South Korean government agency said it was monitoring reports of the fires and warned that the recalled Note 7 devices should not be used or charged inside airplanes.	O	O
Mobile carriers also took action on Monday.	O	O
AT&T, the second biggest mobile operator in the US, said it would stop issuing replacement Note 7s and would let customers with a recalled Note 7 exchange that device for another Samsung smartphone or other smartphone of their choice.	O	O
The third biggest American operator, T-Mobile US, said it was temporarily halting sales of new Note 7s as well as exchanges while Samsung investigated "multiple reports of issues" with its flagship device.	O	O
T-Mobile offered customers who brought in their Note 7s a $25 credit on their phone bill.	O	O
Australia's largest carrier, Telstra, said Samsung had paused supply of new Note 7s, while fellow Australian carriers Optus and Vodafone said they had stopped issuing new Note 7s.	O	O
South Korea's two largest mobile carriers, SK Telecom and KT, said they were monitoring the situation.	O	O

In a Tuesday regulatory filing, Samsung announced it would stop manufacturing Note 7s for the sake of consumer safety.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
Samsung recalled the cellphones earlier this year after a rash of reports complaining that the devices spontaneously caught fire.	O	O
After surveying the recalled phones, the company said it had identified a manufacturing defect in the batteries, leading the top-of-the-line phones top blow up while charging.	O	O
Samsung will either provide a full refund at the original price or replace Note 7 units with any other model of Samsung phone.	O	O
The company began shipping new, improved Note 7s which were supposed to be safer.	O	O

Samsung flags $5.3 billion profit hit from Note 7 failure
Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Friday said it expected to take a hit to its operating profit of about $3 billion over the next two quarters due to the discontinuation of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
The outlook brings to about $5.3 billion the total losses the global smartphone leader has forecast as a result of the overheating issues, after it said on Wednesday it would suffer a $2.3 billion hit to third-quarter profit.	O	O
The premium device that was meant to compete with Apple Inc’s latest iPhones at the top end of the smartphone market had to be scrapped earlier this week, less than two months after its launch, due to safety fears.	O	O
The South Korean tech giant said in a statement on Friday it expected the blow to profit to be in the mid-3 trillion won over the next two quarters - in the mid-2 trillion won range in the October-December period and about 1 trillion won ($900 million) for the first quarter of 2017.	B	Samsung
Samsung shares, which have fallen about 8 percent this week, edged up 0.6 percent as of 0228 GMT on Friday, versus a 0.5 percent gain on the broader market.	O	O
To make up for the lost revenue, Samsung said it would expand sales of gadgets like the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge phones, and make “significant changes” in its quality assurance processes to improve product safety.	O	O
Investors and analysts said that while the company had to move quickly to reassure the market about the potential financial costs, deeper losses from one of the tech industry’s most spectacular product failures could not be ruled out.	O	O
Reputational damage remained the great unknown and potentially more harmful than recall costs, with rivals in the cut-throat industry eager to pounce on any sign of weakness in the market leader’s standing among consumers.	O	O
“The sales impact on other models remains unclear,” said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management, which owns Samsung Electronics shares.	O	O
“The end of the premium model will damage Samsung’s brand, and hurt demand for its other models.	O	O
It is difficult to measure such impact.	O	O
”An advertisement of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is seen at a mobile phone shop in Hanoi, Vietnam October 12, 2016.	O	O
REUTERS/KhamSamsung posted earnings of $7.2 billion in the second quarter, with mobile profits - its biggest earner - soaring 57 percent.	O	O
REBUILDING TRUST The Note 7 debacle has come at an awkward time for South Korea’s biggest family-run conglomerate, which is in the middle of a leadership succession and is facing calls for a major restructuring from U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management.	O	O
Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management which owns shares in Samsung affiliates, said that although future losses would not be as bad as the third quarter the company had to work hard to rebuild confidence.	B	Samsung
Slideshow (2 Images)“What’s important is whether the flagship S7 can fill the gap left by the Note 7, and how much trust Samsung can regain from consumers by the time the S8 comes out,” he said.	O	O
Analysts expect the S8 to be released in the first quarter.	O	O
Key to brand recovery would be rapidly finding out and communicating what went wrong with the Note 7, which was recalled when some devices were found to be combustible and finally discontinued when customers reported similar faults in their replacements.	O	O
The company blamed faulty batteries for the original problem but it has given no inkling about the cause of overheating in the replacements.	O	O
“Samsung must announce clearly what the reason was and dispel uncertainty,” Park said.	O	O
Investors were also expecting the company to show its “commitment to shareholders” by announcing share buybacks or higher dividends, he said.	O	O
Samsung has announced financial incentives for U.S. and South Korea customers who exchange Note 7s for other Samsung products, as part of efforts to stem customer defections.	O	O

Attempting to repair the damage to its brand from combustible smartphones that have burned at least 13 people, Samsung Electronics on Thursday widened its recall and upped the incentives to persuade customers to return their Note 7s.	O	O
The South Korean company, the world’s largest manufacturer of smartphones, also widened its recall to 1.9 million Note 7 phones, which includes the 1 million Galaxy Note 7s initially recalled on Sept. 15.	O	O
Play VideoThe decision to include new Galaxy Note 7 replacement devices as part of the expanded recall came three days after after the company gave up on the high-end device, stopping the production, sale and exchange of the product.	O	O
Samsung has received 96 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S., including 23 new reports since the recall announcement, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).	O	O
Samsung has received 13 reports of burns and 47 reports of property damage related to the Note 7 phones, the CPSC added.	O	O
The CPSC and Samsung are pushing for a 100 percent response rate to the recall, which has proven “a real challenge for Samsung,” Elliot Kaye, chairman of the CPSC, said in a statement.	O	O
“I am very concerned that consumers who exchanged their phones for replacement Galaxy Note 7s are now at risk again.	O	O
Starting Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m.	O	O
ET, consumers who trade a Note 7 for another Samsung smartphone will get up to a $100 credit, while customers trading a Note 7 for a refund or another smartphone made by another manufacturer will get a $25 credit.	O	O

Photo: APSamsung on Tuesday called a worldwide halt to the sale and exchange of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, citing continued safety concerns, and advised all customers to stop using the device immediately.	O	O
The dramatic warning came in a written statement issued a little over a month after the world’s largest smartphone maker announced a global recall of 2.5 million Note 7s in 10 markets following complaints that its lithium-ion battery exploded while charging.	O	O
The unprecedented recall was a major blow for the South Korean conglomerate, which prides itself on innovation and quality, and the situation only worsened when reports emerged a week ago of replacement phones also catching fire.	O	O
Tuesday’s statement was the first formal acknowledgement of continued safety concerns and came a day after Samsung Electronics acknowledged it was easing production of the flagship smartphone.	O	O
“Because consumers’ safety remains our top priority, Samsung will ask all carrier and retail partners globally to stop sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note 7 while an investigation is taking place,” the statement said.	O	O
Analysts noted that the move came a little late given that a number of major distributors -- US telecom firm AT&T and German rival T-Mobile -- unilaterally announced a halt to sales and exchanges of the model on Sunday.	O	O
A Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 7 is seen at the company's headquarters in Seoul, South Korea.	O	O
Photo: ReutersSamsung said its investigation of the “recently reported cases” involving the Note 7 was being carried out in cooperation with the relevant regulatory bodies in those markets where the recall was ordered.	O	O
In the meantime, the company advised any consumer with an original or replacement Galaxy Note 7 to “power down and stop using the device” immediately.	O	O
A similar switch-off warning was issued by Elliot Kaye, chairman of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.	O	O
“No one should have to be concerned their phone will endanger them, their family or their property,” Kaye said in a press release.	B	Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
Samsung’s decision to halt sales and exchanges was “the right move” Kaye said, adding that his commission was actively investigating reports of phones overheating and burning in multiple US states.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
Analysts have suggested that Samsung, battling ever-fiercer competition in the saturated smartphone market, may have rushed production of the Note 7 with bitter rival Apple’s recently released iPhone 7 in mind.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
The top-of-the-line Note 7 was crucial to Samsung’s growth plans this year, with the company struggling to boost sales, squeezed by Apple in the high-end sector and Chinese rivals in the low-end market, as profit has stagnated.	O	O
The trouble with the Note 7 and the handling of the recall, which analysts say could cost up to US$2.0 billion, has shone a spotlight on Samsung’s management at a time when it is navigating a tricky generational power transfer within its founding Lee family.	O	O
Samsung Electronics Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.	O	O
Photo: APIndustry experts have criticised the Lee dynasty for controlling the vast group through a complex web of cross-shareholdings, even though they directly own only about five per cent of total stocks.	O	O
And Samsung is also under pressure from one of its shareholders, the activist US hedge fund Elliott Management run by billionaire Paul Singer.	O	O
In a detailed proposal unveiled last week, Elliott laid out a strategy for streamlining Samsung, splitting the company in two, dual-listing the resulting operating company on a US exchange and paying shareholders a special dividend of 30 trillion won ($27 billion).	O	O
Elliott argued that Samsung, currently a maze of listed and unlisted companies with a notoriously opaque ownership and management structure, had suffered from a long-term undervaluation in the equity market.	B	Samsung
Despite all its problems, Samsung on Friday issued a stronger-than-expected operating profit forecast for the third quarter, thanks largely to strong sales of memory chips and OLED display panels.	O	O

At least four Samsung phones smoked or caught fire during the week, including one on a Southwest Airlines  Co. flight before takeoff.	O	O
It wasn’t clear if those affected were Note 7 devices, or if the problems were because of faulty lithium-ion batteries.	O	O
“We’re no longer exchanging new Note 7s at this time, pending further investigation of these reported incidents,” AT&T said in a statement.	O	O

Samsung Electronics  Co. said it expects about another $3 billion in lost income from to its move to scrap the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 phone, raising the financial impact of the crisis to the equivalent of about half of its profit last year in the mobile division.	O	O
In a statement on Friday, Samsung said it anticipates a fall in operating profit of around 2.5 trillion Korean won ($2.2 billion) in the final three months of this year, and around 1 trillion won for first quarter of next year due to the Note 7’s discontinuation.

RelatedTogether with its earlier forecast of a 2.6 billion won operating profit slide in the third quarter tied to the Note 7, Samsung’s total expected loss is around half of the company’s 10.13 trillion won operating profit in the mobile division in 2015.	O	O
The projections include expected lost sales and costs related to the discontinuation of the Note 7.	O	O
To steady its mobile business, which accounted for about a third of its overall profit last year, Samsung said it would try to expand sales of flagship models such as its Galaxy S series.	O	O
Samsung said on Thursday it would offer a $100 credit for U.S. customers who turn in their Galaxy Note 7 device for another Samsung smartphone.	O	O
Samsung also said Friday it would make “significant changes” in its quality assurance process following criticism of poor communication and a slow response to consumer complaints, particularly after reports emerged last month of replacement Note 7 devices catching fire.	O	O
The decision to pull the plug on the Note 7 this week came more than a month after Samsung first issued a global recall of 2.5 million smartphones following its August 7 launch.	O	O
The impact on Samsung’s bottom line from the Note 7 crisis has been a subject of intense speculation among analysts.	O	O

A damaged Samsung Galaxy Note7
A damaged Samsung Galaxy Note7It has been interesting to watch the debacle of the Samsung Galaxy 7, ending when the company finally decided to stop manufacture and global sales last Tuesday. paired with other recent issues including washing machines that spontaneously burst into flames — shows that it’s time for us to rethink how we protect Australian consumers.	O	O
A quick recap: the Samsung Galaxy Note7 made the news when the phones started exploding.	O	O
It was then discovered that the cause was a battery manufacturing process that was rushed to get the phone out, ostensibly to be released before the latest iPhone was announced.	O	O
Then the company suggested that consumers return the phones to retailers for a replacement.	O	O
But then the replacements started exploding too.	O	O
Samsung initiated a voluntary recall, and after some back-and-forth eventually ceased the manufacture of devices, and told retailers to stop selling them.	O	O
Beyond anything else, the bad press of having newspapers and even airlines announce your brand specifically as selling exploding phones seemed to have finally made it realise that it was time to pull the plug.	O	O
Samsung has a bad track record recently, with a series of washing machines (made between 2010 and 2013) that spontaneously burst into flames.	O	O
These were eventually recalled, but even three years later only 80 per cent have had the issue resolved — allegedly with “a plastic bag and tape”, according to media reports.	O	O
The Australian Consumer Law provides some consumer protection against products or services that don’t meet expected standards, including those that explode or burst into flames.	O	O
That includes the legislation that results in the voluntary recall notices you might see in a newspaper (but rarely elsewhere, which seems strange given we live in a modern, digital age).	O	O
Both of these situations are great examples of the government’s need to intervene immediately and make use of the stronger protections available to it, rather than relying on manufacturers to issue a voluntary recall.	O	O
For example, after early reports of the replacement Samsung phones also exploding, the government should have issued what it calls an “interim ban”.	O	O
These bans stop manufacturers and other retailers from selling or providing a specific product for 60 days or until a defect is resolved (and can be extended), but they are very rarely used.	O	O
They were most recently used to ban hoverboards that didn’t meet the standards already expected of electronic goods, and before that, in 2013, to ban some goods that contained synthetic drugs.	O	O
A total of three bans have been made since the legislation was established in 2010.	O	O
While Samsung eventually said that it would stop selling and manufacturing the phones (even after they were “fixed”), that doesn’t really do much.	O	O
But a voluntary recall is like asking a property developer nicely to stop donating money, rather than banning it altogether.	O	O
It feels strange to call for greater regulation, but until recently you could still buy a Galaxy Note7 online, and not just from eBay or Gumtree.	O	O
This is the exact type of situation against which the Australian Consumer Law was designed to protect consumers, and the government has failed to adequately respond to what is a very serious issue — after all, people carry their phones in their pocket	O	O
Samsung’s notice that it was stopping manufacture was issued way too late, and there has been some debate about whether the company allegedly knew about the “fixed” phones having the same issue for several days before taking action.	O	O
Regardless, it is clear that its priority has been to rush out a product without meeting the simple safety standards anyone would expect.	B	Samsung
In situations like this, the government should step in much earlier to issue a ban, and ensure that companies like Samsung can’t just throw up some newspaper ads and claim that its responsibility is over — it should be hunting down every phone (or washing machine), and sales should stop immediately from all channels.	I	Samsung
Doing anything else is putting consumers needlessly at risk, and ignores what the law was designed to do.	I	Samsung

Samsung gives up and recalls all Note 7s after canceling production
The electronics giant announced it had canned production of the Note 7 this week, as it was unable to determine why the phones had started to spontaneously catch fire.	O	O
The extension means that even consumers who acted on the original recall and were issued a new Note 7 are able to give back their Note 7 for a Galaxy S7, S7 edge or a refund.	O	O
"The safety of our customers is our first priority, which is why we are taking this further step and extending the current recall to all Galaxy Note 7 devices, including replacement Galaxy Note 7 devices," Samsung Electronics Australia vice-president of IT and mobile, Richard Fink, said in a statement.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
The full recall is a disaster for Samsung, which is easily the largest Android smartphone maker and the nearest rival to Apple in Australia when it comes to handset sales.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
The Note 7 hit the market in August to rave reviews, but not long afterwards photos and videos started to emerge of the phones exploding or appearing burnt.	O	O
Batteries not to blameThe first recall was announced in Korea on September 2 and Samsung said the defect was caused by faulty batteries and the company began to dispatch phones with a battery from a different supplier.	O	O
Despite this, it shortly became clear that the batteries were not the problem, as the second batch of phones also started exploding.	O	O
The US Consumer Product Safety Commission says on its website that it has received 92 reports of overheating batteries, 55 reports of property damage and 26 reports of burns.	O	O
In Australia there were 50,000 Note 7s recalled, but its unclear how many incidents.	O	O
On Wednesday Samsung shares on the Korean Exchange were down 1.81 per cent at 4pm AEDT, on the back of an 8 per cent fall on Tuesday.	O	O
Other headachesThis is not the first recall Samsung has experienced in the local market.	O	O
In 2013 it was forced to order back 144,451 top loader washing machines after it found problems with condensation on the electrical connectors.	O	O
Earlier this year it also announced it would be reassessing 32,000 repaired machines after the problem persisted in a small number of machines.	O	O
While Samsung is dealing with this latest drama, Apple has problems of its own, but on a different scale.	O	O

Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall to cost at least $5.3 billion
2 trillion won range during the October-December period and an additional 1 trillion won ($884 million) during the January-March quarter, the company said in a statement.	O	O
Samsung already slashed its third-quarter profit forecast by $2.6 billion earlier this week, an amount that could wipe out its entire mobile business profit.	O	O
That did not include the cost of Samsung's first recall, which analysts estimated at 1 trillion won to 2 trillion won.	O	O
Samsung added that it will make significant changes in its quality assurance processes to enhance product safety for consumers.	O	O
It did not elaborate.	O	O
The company said it will expand sales of two other smartphones released in spring, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, quashing rumors that it may try to release updated versions of those devices.	O	O
Samsung usually releases a new iteration of the Galaxy S series in spring, so the company may have to provide a strong incentive to sell the 6-month-old phones, such as lowering their prices.	O	O
Due to unexplained fires and overheating problems, more than 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones were recalled before the product was discontinued earlier this week just two months after its launch in August.	O	O
In the United States, 1.9 million Note 7 phones are subject to the two recalls.	O	O
Samsung also recalled about 200,000 phones in China and about half a million phones in South Korea.	O	O
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said there were 96 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the country, including 23 new reports since the first recall announcement last month.	O	O
The company received 13 reports of burns and 47 reports of property damages associated with the phones.	O	O
"Consumers should immediately stop using and power down all Galaxy Note 7 devices, including Note 7 devices received as replacements in the previous recall," the agency said.	O	O
The botched recall raised questions about Samsung's initial analysis of the Note 7 phone's problems.	O	O
At first, Samsung said a minor manufacturing error in the batteries for the Note 7 was causing the phones to overheat.	O	O
The problem with the replacements is still unclear.	O	O
Experts say Samsung may have rushed to conclude the Note 7's problem was a battery issue and it may take a long time to find the real cause.	B	Samsung
The Note 7 device was one of the most expensive smartphones in the market with all the latest technologies from Samsung, including the ability to unlock the phone by scanning a user's iris.	O	O
It was sold for between $850 and $890.	O	O

Samsung Electronics  Co. cut its preliminary third-quarter earnings guidance figures Wednesday, a day after announcing that it would permanently discontinue its troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.	O	O
In a reflection of the widening financial impact of its product safety crisis, the South Korean technology giant lowered its operating profit estimate for the three months ended Sept. 30 to 5.2 trillion Korean won ($4.6 billion) from an original estimate of 7.8 trillion won.	O	O
It also lowered its expected revenue for the quarter to 47 trillion won from an original estimate of 49 trillion won.	O	O
Samsung said last week that its preliminary third-quarter earnings guidance figures took into account the Galaxy Note 7 recall.	O	O
But the new numbers now factor in the increased likelihood that customers will seek a refund for their Galaxy Note 7 rather than an exchange for a Samsung phone, leading to lower expected earnings for the quarter.	O	O
“The expected direct cost of the discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7 has been reflected,” a company spokeswoman said.	O	O
The full impact of the crisis over phones that are at risk of catching fire will play out over several months.	O	O
On Tuesday, most analysts pegged the cost of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle at about $4 billion, including recall expenses and lost sales.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities in Seoul, said he was now expecting the company to report a small operating loss in the third quarter for Samsung’s mobile division.	B	Samsung
If so, that would mark that business unit’s first quarterly loss stretching back to before its first Note series phone was released in 2011.	O	O
For the last three months of the year, Mr. Lee is projecting a mobile operating profit between 1.5 trillion to 2 trillion won.	O	O
Samsung’s announcement came after a day of trading when Samsung shares slipped another 0.6%, bringing its three-day slide to 10%.	O	O
On Tuesday, investors sent Samsung stock down 8% for its biggest one-day drop in eight years.	O	O

But over the past week, new reports have emerged that some replacement phones are catching on fire, too.	O	O
The company has now halted production of the phones while Samsung and U.S. officials investigate why the new batch of devices seem to be afflicted with the same problem.	O	O
Many people upgrade their phones during the Christmas shopping season, giving Apple and Google an opportunity to fill the Samsung vacuum -- and making it even harder for the South Korean company to bounce back.	O	O
The Pixel is the first phone Google has conceptualised, designed, engineered and tested in-house.	O	O

"Samsung temporarily suspended production of its most expensive phone, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said Monday, asking not to be identified because the decision isn't public.	B	Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
The move came as wireless carriers including AT&T, Vodaphone, T-Mobile US, Sprint, Verizon and Australia's Telstra stopped selling Note 7s following reports of problems with devices thought to be safe.	O	O

In recent months, Samsung had expanded its already considerable market share.	O	O

Apple's shipments dropped 15 per cent to leave it with an 12 per cent market share.	O	O
Now the South Korean company enters the crucial holiday shopping season with no large-screen smartphone.	O	O
Because Samsung and Apple have basically split the market for $700-plus smartphones between them, the latter is a natural beneficiary of Samsung's woes.	O	O

Samsung estimates $3b loss over Galaxy 7 troubles
HunSamsung slashed its third-quarter profit estimate by a third on Wednesday, revising the figure to absorb more than $US2 billion ($2.6 billion) in losses from its decision to end production of its troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone and recall millions of devices around the world.	O	O
Samsung, the world's largest smartphone maker by market share, said it was compelled to revise its estimates to reflect an estimated 2.6 trillion won ($3 billion) loss from its decision to ditch the Galaxy Note 7.	O	O
It was already one of the largest and costliest product recalls in the technology industry.	O	O
Samsung's woes began in August with a growing number of consumer reports that Galaxy Note 7 phones were heating up and catching fire.	O	O
In an unprecedented decision in the smartphone market, Samsung said on September 2 that it would recall as many as 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s around the world while it tried to fix what it called a defective battery.	B	Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
Samsung appeared to bring the crisis under control when it shipped replacement Galaxy Note 7s with batteries that it said were safe.	O	O
Its earnings reports released last week had reflected losses from that decision.	O	O
But consumers began saying that some of the phones with replacement batteries were catching fire, too.	O	O
Carriers in the United States and elsewhere began suspending sales of new Galaxy Note 7s.	O	O
And over the past week, Samsung temporarily stopped its production of Galaxy Note 7s, suspended sales of the phones around the world, and then, on Tuesday, killed production of the model entirely.	O	O
In the new earnings report, Samsung said it earned 5.2 trillion won in the third quarter, 33.3 per cent less than the 7.8 trillion won profit it had estimated last week.	O	O
It said it had also cut its sales estimate for the quarter by 2 trillion won, to 47 trillion won.	O	O
The revised profit for the third quarter marked a 29.6 per cent drop from the year-earlier period.	O	O
Samsung shares ended Wednesday's trading 0.65 per cent down, after suffering an 8 per cent fall on Tuesday.	O	O
Samsung has not said what caused the fires in the Galaxy Note 7, one of the company's most ambitious products in recent years, a gadget packed with innovations it had hoped would help it compete with Apple in the high-end smartphone market.	O	O
Strategy Analytics, a research company, had estimated that Samsung could lose more than $US10 billion because of the phone's troubles.	O	O
Analysts said the true scale of the financial losses from the Galaxy Note 7 problems was hard to quantify, given the damage to Samsung's brand name and negative publicity that could drive consumers away from the company's other products.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone

Samsung Electronics permanently discontinued production of its troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone Tuesday.
Google and Samsung helped get each other to the top of the smartphone heap.	O	O
So there is some irony to the idea that Samsung’s pain could now be Google’s gain.	O	O
Samsung has long been the world’s most dominant smartphone brand by market share.	O	O
Google, owned by Alphabet, developed the Android mobile operating system that now powers more than 80% of the smartphones sold in the world, including nearly all of Samsung’s.	O	O
But the two companies’ competitive interests aren’t always aligned, a fact that will get ever clearer as Google launches a new brand of smartphones just as Samsung’s reputation is getting scorched.	O	O
Samsung permanently discontinued production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones Tuesday after less than two months on the market.	O	O
Users reported several instances of their devices overheating and even catching fire.	O	O
The Note 7 is a key member of Samsung’s Galaxy line of high-end smartphones, and its absence from the market will leave a void in the market for large-screen devices.	B	Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
Expect others to capitalize on the opportunity.	O	O
Chinese smartphone maker Huawei is making a big push to gain market share from Samsung with its latest P9 smartphone.	O	O
Other Chinese smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi are also targeting Samsung’s share in that key market.	O	O
And while Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus requires users to make a complete platform shift, long-term damage to Samsung’s reputation can only help its rival as it deals with the challenges of its own slowing business.	O	O

The Pixel devices unveiled last week represent a substantial increase in Google’s hardware efforts relative to the Nexus smartphones the company has designed with partners for the last six years.	O	O
The Pixel offers the company’s AI-powered Google Assistant at its core.	O	O
The voice-activated feature will draw on Google’s strength in search, making it potentially more powerful than Apple’s Siri and Amazon.com ’s Alexa.	O	O
It isn’t clear yet how widely Google will share this technology, which is one benefit of owning the operating system on its phones, a trait it shares with Apple.	O	O
Google’s record in hardware has hardly been stellar.	O	O

Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray estimates the company will build between 5 million and 10 million Pixel smartphones next year.	O	O

Arguing against the Nexus is the dismal record of any recent non-Chinese entrant into the smartphone market.	O	O

The devices can't be carried aboard aircraft even if they've been shut off, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safetyby Jungah LeeAll Samsung Electronics Note 7 smartphones will be banned from airline flights by the US government, according to a person familiar with the decision that will be a significant expansion of restrictions on the devices linked to almost 100 incidents of overheating and fires.	O	O
Flight restrictions were extended to each of the 1.9 million Note 7s sold in the US and the devices now can't be carried aboard aircraft even if they've been shut off, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration will announce on Friday.	O	O
Samsung on Tuesday said it was halting production and sales of the device following the latest spate of smoke, overheating and fire incidents in what was supposed to be a version that replaced a faulty lithium-ion battery with a safe one.	B	Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
The company estimates the crisis will cost it $US5.3 billion in profits.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
The Suwon, South Korea-based company disclosed on Friday a negative impact of approximately mid-3 trillion won ($US3 billion) on operating profit through March 2017, on top of an already announced $US2.3 billion cut for the preceding period.	O	O
Samsung disclosed on Friday a negative impact of approximately mid-3 trillion won ($US3 billion) on operating profit.	O	O
The total of $US5.3 billion is in line with analysts' estimates.	O	O
Chung Chang-Won at Nomura Holdings, had estimated that the Note 7 termination would cost the company about $US5 billion in operating profit through 2017.	O	O
Investors appear to have factored in an impact of that magnitude, and Samsung shares rose 1.3 per cent to 1.577 million won at the close in Seoul.	O	O
"Samsung just has to bear it," said Yoo Jong-Woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
The top priority is to "rebuild trust", he said.	I	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
With the dent in revenue, operating profit will be lower by mid-2 trillion won in the fourth quarter and about 1 trillion won in the first three months of 2017, Samsung said.	O	O
In addition to the announcements, the company had already reported lower-than-projected profit from the mobile division in the prior quarter, partly reflecting the impact of the first few weeks of the Note 7 recall.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
With that factored in, the "costs for the Note 7 crisis totals about 7 trillion won, and that means Samsung has lost about one quarter of income", Yoo said.	B	Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
Leadership called into questionSamsung shares slumped more than 8 per cent this week, wiping about $US20 billion from its market value.	O	O
That has also attracted investors who are betting that the company is moving fast enough to deal with the debacle and that it offers long-term value.	O	O
The company said it plans to make up for lost revenue by expanding sales of flagship models such as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.	O	O
Samsung has been struggling with the fallout from the troubled Note 7 phones, which were overheating and catching fire even after a recall that was supposed to fix the problem.	O	O
Samsung said on Tuesday it would kill this generation of the high-end phone.	B	Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
Samsung and vice chairman Jay Y Lee are struggling to contain fallout from the troubled Note 7 phones.	O	O
The debacle is testing Samsung's management and raising questions about whether it needs stronger leadership.	O	O
Lee Kun-hee, the family patriarch, remains chairman even though he suffered a heart attack more than two years ago and hasn't been back at the company since.	O	O
Jay Y, his son, is heir apparent but he hasn't been able to take his father's title because of Korean custom.	O	O
"Samsung will now try its best to do better in other divisions including semiconductors and it will also try hard to promote sales of S7s because there are no alternative Galaxy devices until the first quarter of next year," said Park Kang-Ho at Daishin Securities.	B	Samsung
"The shares will remain pegged around the current levels but may start rising if more restructuring comes out, or the next Galaxy S models succeed.	I	Samsung

Samsung’s troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphones.	O	O
Samsung says the crisis over its exploding Note 7 smartphones will cost another $US3 billion-plus in lost profit over the next two quarters, but it hopes expanded sales of its other flagship handset will help cushion the impact.	O	O
The profit warning came two days after the South Korean electronics giant slashed its operating profit for the third quarter by $US2.3 billion.	O	O
After a recall problem with the large-sized Galaxy Note 7 turned into a full-blown crisis, Samsung announced earlier this week that it was scrapping the model entirely — a devastating move for a company that prides itself on the quality production of cutting-edge technology.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
On top of the third-quarter loss, Samsung said the drop in sales arising from the decision to discontinue the Note 7 would continue to impact profit margins during the October-March period — including the crucial holiday buying season.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
It estimated operating profit loss in the fourth quarter at around the “mid-2 trillion ($US2.2 billion) won range” and 1.0 trillion won for the first quarter of 2017.	O	O
“Moving forward, Samsung Electronics plans to normalise its mobile business by expanding sales of flagship models such as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge,” the company said in a statement.	O	O
Samsung announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in early September after several devices exploded or caught fire.	O	O
When replacement phones also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good.	O	O
The company blamed faulty batteries made by an unnamed supplier — widely believed to be its sister company Samsung SDI.	O	O
But numerous experts and analysts said the problem may have been with the handset’s underlying technology, and Samsung’s decision to rush the launch of the smartphone ahead of the latest iPhone from archrival Apple.	B	Samsung
In its statement, Samsung vowed to “focus on enhancing product safety for consumers by making significant changes in its quality assurance processes.	O	O
”Industry analysts have suggested the Note 7 fiasco could end up costing Samsung anywhere between $US10 billion and $US20 billion, with a lot of the losses tied up with the harder-to-calculate damage done to brand reputation.	B	Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
“And this figure doesn’t take into account the huge marketing costs for Samsung to win back customer loyalty and to regain the trust of mobile carriers,” said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities “It will have to spend a lot of money to recover and much work has to be done,” Roh said.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
Korea’s stock market, which has largely factored in the inevitable profit hit Samsung will be forced to take, reacted calmly to today’s announcement.	O	O
Samsung’s share price dropped 0.4 per cent at the opening bell, but then recovered to move into positive territory, up 0.5 per cent.	O	O

SAN FRANCISCO – Samsung said it is halting sales of the star-crossed Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after a spate of fires involving new devices that were supposed to be safe replacements for recalled models.	B	Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
In a statement issued late Monday, Samsung said consumers with original Note 7 devices or replacements they obtained after the recall should turn off the power and seek a refund or exchange them for different phones.	O	O
Separately, South Korean authorities said in a statement that they found a new product defect in the Note 7 and likewise asked consumers to power them down or to exchange them.	O	O
The statement did not identify the defect.	O	O
Officials from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission echoed advice in their own statement, adding that they are continuing to investigate at least five incidents of fire or overheating reported since a formal recall was announced Sept. 15.	O	O
“No one should have to be concerned their phone will endanger them, their family or their property,” said Elliot Kaye, chairman of the safety commission, in a statement.	B	Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
He called Samsung’s decision to suspend all sales “the right move” in light of “ongoing safety concerns.	B	Samsung to Permanently Discontinue Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
”The announcement follows several new incidents of overheating last week and deals a further blow to the world’s largest smartphone company.	O	O
Leading wireless carriers have already said they would stop distributing new Note 7 phones as replacements for the earlier recall.	B	Galaxy Note 7 Smartphone
Analysts say the new problems pose a crisis for the South Korean tech giant, which is locked in fierce competition with Apple and other leading smartphone makers.	O	O
“This has been a real black eye on the product,” said Ben Bajarin, a consumer tech industry analyst with the Creative Strategies firm.	O	O
The new reports also raise questions about the cause of the problem.	O	O
Samsung has blamed batteries provided by a particular supplier, while assuring consumers that the phone was otherwise safe.	O	O
It said it solved the problem by switching to batteries from another supplier.	O	O
The tech conglomerate reported last week that its overall profits increased in the last quarter, thanks to booming sales in other corporate units that sell computer chips and display screens.	O	O
The Note 7 is not Samsung’s most popular device; Samsung sells far more units of its Galaxy S7 phones than the more expensive Note 7 device.	O	O
But analysts worry the issue could hurt the company’s reputation and overall standing with consumers.	O	O
Samsung sells about a third of all high-end smartphones priced above $400, while Apple sells slightly more than half, according to Credit Suisse investment analyst Kulbinder Garcha.	O	O
He predicted in a report Monday that the new Note 7 problems will help Apple increase its share of the market.	O	O

Foxconn Pauses Its Proposed $6.2 Billion Acquisition Of Sharp
Foxconn’s  proposed acquisition of Sharp has hit a snag, just hours after Japan-based Sharp announced that it had agreed to the buyout, which is estimated at around $6.2 billion.	B	a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
The Wall Street Journal reports that, despite Sharp’s  confirmation, Foxconn has not signed an agreement and has put the deal on hold because it harbors concerns over Sharp’s financial future.	B	a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
The Journal cites sources who claim that Foxconn is evaluating a 100-point list in the hopes that it can revive the deal.	B	Taiwan's Foxconn
“We already notified Sharp on the same day [before Sharp held its board meeting on Thursday] that our side had to clarify the contents,” the company told the Journal in a statement.	O	O
“We have to postpone the signing before both sides can reach an agreement.	O	O
We hope to clarify it quickly and to bring this deal to a successful conclusion.	O	O
”The glitch is an embarrassment for Sharp, which had confirmed a deal — approved unanimously by its board — just hours earlier.	O	O
The deal — if completed — would be the largest acquisition of a Japanese company from an overseas purchaser.	O	O
Sharp disclosed that it actually reject a Japan-based bid from state-backed Innovation Network Corp, which had proposed splitting Sharp and its display business, and integrating the latter into Japan Display, an LCD joint venture between Sony, Toshiba, and Hitachi.	O	O
Sharp disclosed that Foxconn had agreed in invest in multiple areas of its business, including its OLED screen segment.	B	Taiwan's Foxconn
Sharp said its plans to increase its production of OLED screens, which are increasingly replacing LEDs thanks to better performance, to 90 million 5.5-inch screens per year by 2019.	B	Sharp
That output volume is estimated to worth around 260 billion yen, or $2.3 billion.	O	O
Sharp said it will also create products around the Internet of things, and in particular cloud-based services for its consumer products, and develop new camera modules for smartphones and cars.	B	Sharp
Sharp has been in various stages of financial trouble over the past few years, but the company still has a visible consumer electronics business — most notable in TVs — and it supplies a range of components for leading tech companies.	B	Sharp
The latter part is where Foxconn’s interest almost certainly lies, particularly since Sharp is a top producer of display panels, which happens to be one area where Foxconn (also known as Hon Hai Precision) outsources parts from third-parties.	I	Sharp
Potentially bringing its own parts to the table, should it acquire Sharp, could be beneficial to Foxconn on a number of levels.	O	O
First, it’s cheaper to source your own parts than pay market rate to third parties who currently supply them.	O	O
Also, the arrangement could favor Apple — Foxconn’s most important client — because Foxconn’s panels currently come from companies like Samsung and LG, which sell components and run consumer businesses that directly rival Apple’s smartphones and tablets.	O	O
Thus using display panels from Foxconn-owned Sharp increases Foxconn’s (already significant) margins on each Apple device sold, and helps keep Apple’s money away from its competitors.	O	O
Beyond that, Foxconn has also branched out into electronics under its own brand, including TVs which retail in 7-Eleven stores in its native Taiwan.	B	Taiwan's Foxconn
Clearly there are synergies here with Sharp in the TV business, and potential other consumer segments like smartphones.	B	Sharp
A closed deal would end years of Foxconn flashing admiring glances at Sharp.	O	O
Four years ago, it came close to securing a 10 percent investment in the Japanese firm, only for the deal to fall through, while Foxconn CEO Terry Gou made a $617 million (personal) investment in a Sharp subsidiary in 2012 in an effort to move potential collaborations forward.	O	O

Hon Hai, Sharp may revise terms of approved deal
Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (鴻海精密) and Japan’s Sharp Corp worked through the weekend to salvage their US$6 billion deal, with revisions to terms the Japanese firm put forth last week, people familiar with the matter said.	O	O
Bankers and lawyers are going through a list of Sharp liabilities that could exceed ￥300 billion (US$2.6 billion), a last-minute stumbling block in Hon Hai’s effort to take control of the struggling Japanese company, according to the people, who asked not to be identified, as the talks are not public.	O	O
It is not clear if Hon Hai, known as Foxconn Technology Group (富士康科技集團) outside Taiwan, would lower its offer or change its bid in some other way, the people said, adding that any material changes would require Sharp’s board to vote again.	B	a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
Foxconn founder and chairman Terry Gou (郭台銘) has fought for months to take over Sharp, battling a competing offer from a once-favored domestic bidder, Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ).	O	O
Foxconn offered a package worth in excess of ￥600 billion — more than twice INCJ’s bid — with most of the money going into Sharp through the purchase of additional shares.	O	O
Only hours after Sharp’s board approved its offer on Thursday, Foxconn said it received new information from Sharp and would not go through with the deal until it resolved the issues.	O	O
“It’s a complicated situation.	O	O
It’s difficult to judge whether Foxconn is shaking up Sharp or they really need some time to check the facts,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo.	O	O
Sharp’s stock fell 2.3 percent to ￥129 in Tokyo trading yesterday.	O	O
Its shares fell 21 percent last week.	O	O
Foxconn has made it clear it was surprised by the latest information from Sharp.	B	Sharp
On Friday, Foxconn said it had received new documents on Wednesday last week — the day before the Sharp board decision — that had never been submitted in previous talks.	O	O
Its financial adviser, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and legal adviser Baker & McKenzie are discussing the matter with Sharp to clarify the situation and seek solutions, it said.	O	O
Sharp has said it did nothing wrong.	O	O
On Friday, the Osaka-based company said it has properly disclosed contingent liabilities and is discussing them with Foxconn.	O	O
The Japanese firm has appointed Toshihiko Fujimoto, formerly chairman of its electronics unit, to the post of “head of strategic alliance,” it said in a stock exchange filing yesterday.	O	O
In his new role, Fujimoto will lead the negotiations with Foxconn and oversee their subsequent cooperation, Sharp spokesman Toyodo Uemura said.	O	O
Though the contingent liabilities, which are triggered by events such as restructuring or layoffs, could reach ￥300 billion, they could also be much lower, the people familiar with the matter said.	O	O
The two companies have a history of fraught negotiations.	O	O
In 2012, Gou announced plans to invest in Sharp and buy shares at ￥550 a piece, but the deal was never completed as the maker of Aquos TVs posted record losses and its stock tanked.	O	O
Last week’s deal involved buying shares at ￥118 each.	O	O
Foxconn, the primary assembler of iPhones and iPads for Apple Inc, offered a premium for Sharp in a bid to add its business of making the glass displays for Apple’s devices, one of the most valuable components.	O	O
Gou might be reluctant to take on additional financial costs as he tries to make the high-stakes deal pay off.	O	O
Under the plan announced by Sharp, Foxconn would get control over the company by spending ￥484.3 billion to buy additional shares at a discount and give Gou and Foxconn 65.9 percent of the Japanese company.	B	Taiwan's Foxconn
Foxconn would also pay ￥100 billion for preferred shares held by lenders Mizuho Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and additional cash for other assets.	I	Taiwan's Foxconn
Existing shareholders would receive nothing directly under the plan and Sharp would remain a publicly traded company.	B	Sharp
Sharp would keep its brand under new ownership and pledged to maintain employment levels.	I	Sharp
Gou and Sharp CEO Kozo Takahashi also met over the weekend as part of the negotiations, one person familiar with the matter said.	O	O
Sharp might be under greater pressure to make the deal work.	B	Sharp
Besides the share price decline, it also faces the expiration of credit lines with its banks at the end of next month.	O	O
“Sharp wants to close the deal by the end of March, but Foxconn doesn’t have to hurry up because INCJ has already given up.	O	O
It’s a favorable situation for Foxconn,” Yasuda said.	B	Taiwan's Foxconn

What's behind the takeover	O	O
- Karishma Vaswani, Asia Business CorrespondentTrying to save one of the giants of the Japanese tech sector has been challenging to say the least, but even harder if the response in your industry to any foreign takeover deal is usually a no.	O	O
That's because Japan's technology sector is historically extremely insular, and has been reluctant to let outsiders in.	O	O
Partly the concern is fuelled by a fear that Japan's proprietary technological expertise may be at risk - but it's also partly because of a Japanese corporate culture that prefers keeping the dirty laundry in the family.	O	O
But when times are tough, business acumen trumps nationalistic tendencies.	O	O

Sharp issued a 31-page release detailing the proposed agreement but Foxconn later said in a statement that Sharp on Wednesday morning had “couriered over a new key document” that needed clarification and that it had told the Japanese firm of this.	O	O
Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the Japanese group had contingent liabilities that amounted to “hundreds of billions of yen.	O	O
”That issue would have to be resolved before a deal could be finalized, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the talks are confidential.	O	O
The sources did not elaborate on the nature of the liabilities or the exact amount.	O	O
A spokesman for Foxconn declined to comment on the issue.	O	O
Sharp also declined to comment.	O	O
Sharp’s decision comes after five years of courting by Foxconn founder and billionaire Terry Gou, who sees ownership of Sharp as a way to better compete with Asian rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co.	B	Sharp
“Sharp has the technology to build out the components to compete with Samsung as an Apple supplier, which means that with Sharp under its umbrella Foxconn can help Apple wean itself off Samsung,” said Gavin Parry, managing director of Parry International Trading, a brokerage in Hong Kong.	I	Sharp
“This gives Foxconn better pricing power with Apple,” he added.	I	Sharp
Sharp’s board voted unanimously to accept the Foxconn offer over a rescue by a state-backed investment fund, CEO Kozo Takahashi said.	O	O
Sharp said it aimed to become a global supplier of OLED screens, which are thinner, lighter and more flexible than current displays.	B	Sharp
South Korea’s Samsung Display and LG Display are also investing heavily in the new technology.	O	O
The century-old Japanese firm was once a highly profitable manufacturer of premium TVs and a favored screen supplier to Apple.	B	Sharp
But it has struggled in recent years as massive investments in advanced liquid crystal display plants failed to pay off amid price competition with Asian rivals, and two bank bailouts since 2012 did little to help turn its business around.	I	Sharp

The deal, which could be worth as much as $6.2 billion, was agreed at a Sharp board meeting on Thursday, Japanese media including the leading Nikkei business daily reported.	B	a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
Sharp's volatile stock soared nearly six percent on the reports, which come after weeks of speculation over whether it would choose an offer from a domestic investment fund or Taiwan-based Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision, a major Apple supplier.	B	Sharp

Despite its bleeding balance sheet, Sharp remains a leader in liquid crystal display technology, a key asset for Hon Hai.	B	Sharp
The pair have worked together for years on large-sized screen technology, including for televisions, and industry watchers applauded the rare foreign takeover of a Japanese giant.	B	Sharp's board has accepted a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
"Hon Hai and Sharp complement each other," said Yukihiko Nakata, a technology professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University and a former Sharp engineer.	O	O
"Sharp is strong in research and development while Hon Hai knows how to market products to customers such as Apple and it also has expertise in production.	O	O
Together they can go global.	O	O

"The only advantage was economies of scale but that alone is not enough to compete in the global market," Mr Nakata said.	O	O
This month, Sharp's chief Kozo Takahashi refused to be drawn on which offer he favoured, but said his company was putting "more manpower" into evaluating the Taiwanese offer.	B	a takeover bid

Sharp President Kozo Takahashi (left) and Hon Hai Chairman Terry Gou are hoping to close the takeover deal soon.	B	a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
| KYODOSharp Corp. said Monday it hopes to finalize a takeover deal with Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.	B	a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
“as soon as practically possible” without setting a deadline for inking the bailout package.	O	O
“Sharp and Hon Hai Precision Industry have not set a signing date,” the electronics giant said in a statement.	O	O
“Both companies are working hard to reach a satisfactory agreement as soon as practically possible.	O	O
”The statement came after sources familiar with the matter said before the weekend that Sharp and Hon Hai agreed to extend their negotiation deadline beyond Monday, and that Hon Hai’s proposal would remain valid until then.	O	O
Sharp decided Thursday to accept an offer from Hon Hai, better known by its trade name Foxconn, to take over the Osaka-based firm, in what would be the first acquisition of a major Japanese electronics maker by a foreign company.	B	a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
But hours later, Hon Hai announced it would delay the signing of a deal to clarify the content of a document submitted Wednesday by Sharp.	O	O
The document is believed to include information about liabilities that could be incurred by Sharp, which has been hit by losses in its liquid crystal display business.	O	O
Hon Hai said Friday in a statement that most of the document’s content had not been provided during past negotiations between the two companies.	O	O
But it expressed hope that a satisfactory agreement could be reached with Sharp.	O	O
Sharp President Kozo Takahashi and Hon Hai Chairman Terry Gou met in China on Friday, while officials of both firms have been trying to pave a way for the deal.	O	O
Bankers and lawyers are going through a list of Sharp’s liabilities that could exceed ¥300 billion, a last-minute stumbling block in Hon Hai’s bid to take control of the struggling Sharp, according to the sources.	B	Sharp
It’s still too early to tell whether Hon Hai will lower the value of its offer or change its bid in some other way, the sources said.	B	a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
Any substantial change would require Sharp’s board to vote once again on the altered proposal, they said.	O	O
Hon Hai’s Gou has fought for months to take over Sharp, battling a competing offer from a once-favored domestic bidder, Innovation Network Corp. of Japan.	O	O
Hon Hai offered a package worth in excess of ¥600 billion — more than twice INCJ’s bid — with most of the money going into Sharp through the purchase of additional shares.	O	O
“It’s a complicated situation.	B	Taiwan's Foxconn
It’s difficult to judge whether Foxconn is shaking up Sharp or they really need some time to check the facts,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo.	I	Taiwan's Foxconn
Hon Hai, the primary assembler of iPhones and iPads for Apple Inc., offered a premium for Sharp in a bid to gain control of the latter’s business of making glass displays for Apple’s devices, one of the most valuable components.	B	a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
Gou may be reluctant to take on additional financial costs as he tries to make the high-stakes deal pay off.	O	O
Under the plan accepted by Sharp, Hon Hai would get control over the company by spending ¥484.3 billion to buy additional shares at a discount and give Gou and Hon Hai 65.9 percent of the company.	O	O
Hon Hai would also pay ¥100 billion for preferred shares held by lenders Mizuho Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and additional cash for other assets.	O	O
Existing shareholders would receive nothing directly under the plan and Sharp would remain a publicly traded company.	B	Sharp
Sharp would keep its brand under new ownership and has pledged to maintain current employment levels.	I	Sharp
Sharp seems to be under great pressure to make the deal work; besides the decline in its share price, it also faces the expiration of credit lines with its banks at the end of March.	I	Sharp
“Sharp wants to close the deal by the end of March but Foxconn doesn’t have to hurry up because INCJ has already given up.	O	O

“As for the capital offer, Hon Hai’s plan has an edge over INCJ’s, so I think it’s a plus for Sharp,” said Toshiro Sato, an analyst at Kyokuto Research Institute.	B	a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
Hon Hai’s ¥660 billion bid far overshadowed INCJ’s ¥300 billion offer.	O	O
However, the analysts noted concerns about the fate of Sharp’s current management team and how Hon Hai will tackle job cuts to facilitate structural reform.	B	Sharp
Moreover, they said INCJ’s vision of a restructuring in Japan’s electronics industry seems unlikely to come about.	O	O
Sato said that as Hon Hai is helmed by a strong owner, Terry Gou, management decisions are likely to come more quickly, compared with the protracted and opaque decision-making processes of state-backed INCJ.	B	Taiwan's Foxconn
Another analyst who wished to remain anonymous said Hon Hai’s capital is critical for Sharp, whose core business is LCD panels, as such components require continuous investment.	B	Taiwan's Foxconn
“Sharp will be able to secure development capital to reconstruct the LCD business,” the analyst said.	B	Sharp
“The situation will be an improvement on now.	I	Sharp
”On top of the financial boost, becoming a Hon Hai group firm will help Sharp to sell LCD panels to Apple Inc., as Hon Hai manufactures the iPhone — for which Sharp currently provides the screens.	B	Sharp's board has accepted a takeover bid from Taiwan's Foxconn
Sharp may be able to improve its bargaining position with Apple, the analyst said, adding that Hon Hai’s position vis-a-vis Apple would also be strengthened.	B	Sharp
Foxconn is the world’s biggest contract manufacturer of electronics and produces a variety of products under clients’ brands.	B	Taiwan's Foxconn
Sato of Kyokuto Research also said Hon Hai will be able to adapt to its customers’ needs more quickly with Sharp’s LCD technology.	B	Taiwan's Foxconn
Moreover, Sharp could use Foxconn’s manufacturing know-how to assemble its own products for less, said the analyst who asked for anonymity.	B	Sharp
Although Sharp is sure to get some help for reconstruction from Hon Hai, both analysts pointed out potential problems, including the future of the current management team and the issue of job cuts.	B	Sharp
Headed by President Kozo Takahashi, Sharp’s management line-up is expected to remain in place for now.	O	O
The team has overseen efforts to turn the company around since 2013.	O	O
While the tech giant posted a profit in fiscal 2013, Sharp posted a massive net loss of ¥222 billion in fiscal 2014.	O	O
The team came up with a new three-year midterm plan last year, but that is already looking shaky and the firm is expected to fall short of its year-one goal.	O	O
Some, including Sharp shareholders, have voiced doubt over the capability of the current management.	O	O
“I think it’s unrealistic that the current management team will stay,” said Sato.	B	Sharp
He added, Sharp may have made requests to Hon Hai that will become obstacles to an efficient turnaround.	I	Sharp
Sharp asked Hon Hai to retain as many jobs as possible and to keep its business entities intact, despite the view of many experts that job cuts are unavoidable if the firm is to survive.	B	Sharp
“Sharp may get lots of cash, but the structural reform might not go smoothly” if the current management stays and Hon Hai cannot cut jobs, Sato said.	B	Sharp
Unlike Hon Hai, INCJ was planning to spin off Sharp’s businesses and spark a revamp of Japan’s electronics industry.	O	O
The state-backed fund was apparently planning to merge Sharp’s LCD business with Japan Display Inc., and to combine the white goods segments of Sharp, Toshiba and Hitachi, reflecting the government’s hope of strengthening an industry crowded with domestic competitors.	O	O
“The plan was a bit too ambitious, but if it had worked out the industry would have been restructured, and that would have been a plus for Japan in the long term,” Sato said.	O	O

Suzuki Reports Improper Fuel Economy Tests, but Denies Cheating
Suzuki Motor said on Wednesday that it had used improper methods to determine the fuel economy of 16 vehicles it sells in Japan, adding to the list of automakers that have come under scrutiny for how they perform in government tests.	B	Suzuki says it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan
Suzuki said that it had not sought to mislead customers, and that its testing had not exaggerated mileage ratings.	B	Suzuki
It said it did not plan to restate any published ratings.	B	Suzuki says it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan
Still, the disclosure is likely to add to industrywide doubts over carmakers and the fuel-test results they report to governments around the world.	B	Suzuki says it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan
That scrutiny has hit Japan’s auto industry in recent weeks.	O	O
On Wednesday, Mitsubishi Motors said that Tetsuro Aikawa, its president, would resign after the company’s disclosure that its engineers deliberately used unapproved test procedures that exaggerated fuel performance by as much as 15 percent on some models.	O	O
Mitsubishi’s new partner and financial savior, Nissan Motor, was accused by South Korean environmental regulators this week of cheating on fuel tests.	O	O
Nissan has disputed the accusation and said it was working with regulators in that country.	O	O
Suzuki shares fell more than 9 percent in Tokyo on Wednesday after news reports that it would report fuel-test discrepancies and become the latest Japanese automaker to come under scrutiny.	O	O
Osamu Suzuki, Suzuki’s chairman and chief executive, apologized to customers but said the company had retested its vehicles and found no significant differences between the results and their already-published ratings.	O	O
The problem centered on the same testing regulations that tripped up Mitsubishi: the way engineers calculate what is known as running resistance, or the effect that tire friction and other factors have on fuel consumption under various driving conditions.	O	O
Mr. Suzuki said mileage tests at Suzuki’s development track in central Japan had produced inconsistent results, which engineers attributed to wind.	B	it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan
The track is on high ground near the sea.	O	O
Instead of running multiple tests to produce an average, Suzuki engineers cut corners by extrapolating running resistance from past tests, the company said.	B	it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan
That was a violation of regulations, the company said, but did not distort results “beyond the standard margin of error.	I	it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan
”“In effect, we were using a way of measuring that was not approved, and for that I apologize deeply,” Mr. Suzuki said.	I	it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan
The problem came to light after Japanese regulators ordered all carmakers to re-examine their testing methods after the revelations at Mitsubishi last month.	O	O
Mitsubishi acknowledged that it had been cheating on its mileage ratings in Japan for a quarter of a century, and that all models in its domestic lineup were affected.	O	O
Last week, Nissan agreed to extend Mitsubishi a $2.2 billion lifeline in exchange for about one-third of the company.	O	O
In a follow-up report to regulators on Wednesday, Mitsubishi said it had used earlier data to extrapolate running resistance for a number of models, instead of performing multiple new tests for each one.	O	O
The company said it had also misreported test dates and weather conditions in ways that flattered vehicles’ performance.	O	O
It reiterated its position that top executives were unaware of the cheating.	O	O
Even so, it said Mr. Aikawa and Ryugo Nakao, the executive vice president, would leave their positions effective June 24.	O	O
Globally, carmakers’ reporting of fuel economy and pollution ratings is under especially close scrutiny after Volkswagen of Germany admitted last year that it had installed software in 11 million diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests.	O	O

Osamu SuzukiSuzuki Motor Corp. on Wednesday became the latest automaker to admit mistakes in measuring car fuel economy, saying it has been using an unapproved system for determining performance.	O	O
The automaker said an internal investigation, conducted in light of Mitsubishi Motors Corp.	O	O
’s admission of data falsification, found that road and air resistance figures for its entire current range of 16 models were obtained this way.	O	O
Regulations require vehicles to be tested on the road, but Suzuki used data obtained from laboratory-style testing of individual components, such as the tires, brakes and transmission.	O	O
It added that it has been using this method since 2010 because its test track is near the ocean and is windy, which makes testing inconsistent.	B	it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan
Suzuki executive Osamu Honda denied that the firm had tried to make the cars look more fuel efficient, saying engineers “just wanted to get consistent data.	B	it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan
”Honda was speaking at a news conference at the transport ministry, where the Shizuoka-based automaker earlier submitted a report on the matter to officials.	O	O
“In any case, we did not use data collected by a method in line with the Japanese regulation. I deeply apologize for that,” said Osamu Suzuki, the firm’s chairman.	B	it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan
The automaker said it retested the fuel efficiency figures for the affected cars and found that discrepancies were within 5 percent — some better, some worse.	O	O
It called this an acceptable margin.	O	O
Following revelations that Mitsubishi Motors inflated the fuel economy of four minicars and put others through tests that are not approved in Japan, the ministry urged Japanese automakers to check by Wednesday if they have been doing anything similar.	O	O
Suzuki has the second-largest share of minicars in the domestic market, with sales of about 550,000 units in 2015.	O	O
It boasts a major presence in the Indian market.	O	O
Suzuki said its vehicles made for foreign markets are unaffected.	O	O
Meanwhile, Mitsubishi also filed a report to the ministry on Wednesday in which it admitted falsifying the performance figures of four more models — the RVR, Pajero, Outlander PHEV and Delica D:5.	O	O
It earlier named four minicar models as being affected.	O	O
Mitsubishi President Tetsuro Aikawa said he will quit after the firm’s shareholders meeting next month.	O	O
The Tokyo-based automaker said the fuel efficiency gaps for the four new models are within 3 percent — both better and worse — and that it will continue to manufacture and sell them.	O	O
Mitsubishi has halted production and sales of the eK Wagon, eK Space, Dayz and Dayz Roox, as the fuel efficiency gaps were up to 15 percent.	O	O
As for how the data manipulation on the four minicars happened, the report said a manager at a research and development section told Mitsubishi’s subsidiary to prepare “good data,” meaning lower running resistance data, knowing that the automaker’s fuel efficiency target was difficult to achieve.	O	O
Under pressure to achieve the target, the subsidiary went ahead and manipulated road and air resistance data.	O	O
Following the scandal, Nissan Motor Co. said last week that it had begun talks with Mitsubishi Motors to take a 34% stake in the automaker.	O	O

The announcement back in June that electric-car maker Tesla Motors  TSLA -1.30%  would buy solar-energy company SolarCity went down like a lead balloon at the time.	B	Tesla Is Buying Sister Company SolarCity For $2.6 Billion

Trinity Mirror reports 19% print ad slide as it confirms the New Day's closure
Trinity Mirror has reported a fall of nearly 20% in print ad revenues as it confirmed it is to close the New Day after just two months.	O	O
Ahead of its AGM on Thursday, the Daily Mirror publisher said the print advertising market had been “volatile” in the first four months of this year, but digital had bounced back somewhat.	O	O
Trinity Mirror’s trading update, for the period from 28 December to 1 May, highlighted the ongoing tough trading conditions faced by newspaper publishers.	O	O
The New Day newspaper to shut just two months after launch	O	O
The company said print advertising revenues declined by 19% year on year across the period, with newspaper sales falling by 4.5%.	O	O
This ameliorated slightly in April, when print revenues fell by 15.8%.	O	O
However, Trinity Mirror said digital income, which is building from a relatively low base, grew by 15.7% in the four-month period and by 18.6% in April alone.	O	O
“The trading environment for print advertising continues to be volatile,” the company said.	O	O
“We continue to focus on the delivery of our strategy, namely growing our digital audience and revenue, coupled with tight management of the cost base.	O	O
“At this stage, the board anticipates performance for the year will be in line with market expectations.	O	O
”The New Day, which was launched at the end of February with an upbeat £5m ad campaign, “Seize the New Day”, will publish its last issue on Friday.	O	O
Trinity Mirror confirmed the New Day’s closure was because the title failed to sell enough copies.	B	The New Day newspaper to shut
The aim had been to sell in excess of 200,000 per day, but it is understood that at closure sales were hovering around 30,000.	I	The New Day newspaper to shut

”Alison Phillips, the editor of the New Day, said that despite its swift demise it was a worthwhile endeavour to try and stimulate newspaper readership in the UK.	I	The New Day newspaper
“To have not given this a go was to mean we were content to stand on the pavement and watch the decline of British national newspapers hurtle past us,” Phillips said in a Facebook post on Thursday.	O	O
“We have tried everything we could but sadly we just haven’t reached the sales figures we needed to make it work financially.	O	O
”The ethos behind the New Day was to deliver a more upbeat and optimistic product, with a slant toward targeting female readers, to attract a type of reader who had “fallen out of love” with the format of traditional newspapers.	B	The New Day newspaper

The first national newspaper to launch in Britain in 30 years is to close after just two months, its publisher Trinity Mirror (TNI.L) said on Thursday, after it failed to find readers in a print market decimated by the growth of the internet.	O	O
Launched to much fanfare on February 29, the cut price New Day tabloid was designed to be a non-political, optimistic read aimed primarily at women and people who had stopped buying newspapers in recent years.	B	The New Day newspaper
Instead, it sold fewer than 40,000 daily copies in a country of around 65 million people, prompting Trinity Mirror to cut its losses and admit it had overestimated the demand.	O	O
“We have tried everything we could but sadly we just haven’t reached the sales figures we needed to make it work financially,” editor Alison Phillips said in a statement.	O	O
“To have not given this a go was to mean we were content to stand on the pavement and watch the decline of British national newspapers,” she added.	O	O
Britain, home to a centuries-old newspaper industry known as “Fleet Street”, has like the United States seen growing numbers of readers and advertisers abandon print for online editions.	O	O
More than 14 million people from around the world visited the MailOnline website per day in March while just 1.6 million bought the Daily Mail paper.	O	O
Many others get their news from sites such as Buzzfeed or social media platforms including Facebook.	O	O
With big brands paying less to advertise online than they would in a newspaper, that change has put unprecedented pressures on the industry.	O	O
Slideshow (2 Images)Trinity, which also publishes the Daily Mirror, People and local papers, has seen its market value fall more than 80 percent since its peak in 2000.	O	O
It said on Thursday it expected to hit its annual financial targets despite the volatile print advertising market.	O	O
DOOMED ENTERPRISE In March Britain’s Independent newspaper, launched in 1986, scrapped its print run to just publish online and in January the left-leaning Guardian said it would slash running costs to try to break even.	O	O
Despite the challenges, Trinity Mirror’s Chief Executive Simon Fox had said he believed there was a gap in the market for a new title that, at just 50 pence, could lure readers put off by the sensational headlines splashed by many of its rivals.	O	O
The Independent had launched the cut price i newspaper in 2010 to reach younger and different readers, but the New Day was the first standalone paper to launch in 30 years.	O	O
The 40-page paper offered a brief digest of the news and features and did not have a website.	O	O
Trinity has not said how much it spent on the project but analysts believe it had spare capacity on its printing presses.	O	O

The New Day newspaper to shut just two months after launch
Trinity Mirror is to shut its experimental new national newspaper the New Day on Friday just two months after launch.	O	O
The publisher of the Daily Mirror launched the title, which aimed to target those who had “fallen out of love with newspapers”, at the end of February with a promotional print run of about 2m.	B	The New Day newspaper
The title was launched with a £5m TV ad campaign that ran with the strapline “Seize the New Day”.	O	O
Trinity Mirror, which saw its share price slump to a three-year low on Wednesday, is expected to announce the closure of the title in a stock market trading update on Thursday morning.	O	O
The New Day got off to a terrible start, and Trinity Mirror’s bosses are to blame	B	The New Day newspaper
Two sources said staff were informed of the closure on Wednesday.	O	O
The last issue will hit stands on Friday.	O	O
Editor Alison Phillips, who was previously responsible for stablemates the Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, was said by those who attended the internal meeting to be distraught.	O	O
The publisher had aimed to hit paid sales of 200,000, and made promises to advertisers to sell ads at that rate of sales or offer money back, but instead saw its popularity immediately sink to about 30,000 copies per day.	O	O
Trinity Mirror positioned the launch of the title as a low-cost operation running on extra capacity at its printing presses – which also had contracts to print the Independent print titles and still handle the i, which Evgeny Lebedev sold to Johnston Press earlier this year.	O	O
Sources say the New Day was probably running at a loss of about £1m annually.	O	O
A spokeswoman for Trinity Mirror refused to comment.	O	O

Toyota, the Japanese car maker, said it was recalling millions of car worldwide and thousands in the UK over defective airbag concerns and fuel emissions control units.	O	O
Toyota and Lexus will conduct a recall involving certain Toyota Prius, Auris and Lexus CT200h models which affects 72,885 vehicles in the UK.	O	O
Affected vehicles are equipped with an evaporative fuel emissions control unit, mounted in the fuel tank.	O	O
A crack could develop in the canister and may expand over time, eventually leading to a fuel leak when the car has a full tank of petrol.	O	O
Some 34,135 cars, which may also be affected with the previous issue, could have a small crack in some inflators in the airbags in the driver and passenger sides.	O	O
This may expand, causing the airbags to partially inflate and explode.	O	O
The incident could lead to an increased risk of injury if the passenger is in the car when that happens, Toyota said.	O	O
The company said it had so far not received any report of accidents linked to either of the issues.	O	O
The recall of 2.87 million Toyota cars over a possible fault in emission control units on Wednesday, followed a separate announcement on Tuesday that 1.43 million cars also needed airbag repairs.	O	O
Both recalls amount to a total of 3.37 million vehicles worldwide.	O	O
The recall includes 495,000 cars in the US, and 743,000 in Japan as well as vehicles in Europe and China.	O	O
A Toyota spokesman said the airbag inflators in the recall were not produced by Takata.	O	O
Shighehisa Takada, Takata’s chief executive officer, said he will resign on Tuesday, bowing to calls for a change as the company deals with the airbag recall scandal.	O	O
“I am not clinging to this.	O	O
My role is to make sure the company does not take a bad turn until there is a passing of the baton,” he told an annual shareholders meeting, where he came under fire for failing to deal more effectively with the crisis.	O	O
Takata posted its third annual loss in four years in the past financial year and has seen its shares tumble some 90 per cent since early 2014.	O	O
Roughly 100 million of its inflators have been classified as defective due to the possibility that they might explode after prolonged exposure to hot temperatures.	O	O
Volkswagen and Daimler recalled 1.5 million vehicle in the US due to the company.	O	O
BMW, Ford, Honda, Tesla, Toyota and 12 other automakers were also affected.	O	O

“As a result of this condition, the cracks could expand over time and, eventually, fuel may leak from these cracks when the vehicle has a full tank of petrol.	O	O
”The company said it was also aware of seven incidents where a side curtain airbag has partially inflated in parked Toyota Prius cars, but said no injuries had been reported.	O	O
Of the 2.8m vehicles being recalled globally over fears of cracks in the fuel emissions control unit, some 713,000 are in Europe.	O	O
A total of 1.43m Prius hybrid, Prius plug-in and Lexus CT200h models are being recalled globally over concerns about defective airbags, made by Swedish-American firm Autoliv.	O	O
More than 900,000 vehicles are affected by both flaws, meaning Toyota is recalling 3.4m vehicles overall.	O	O
The Autoliv airbag issue is not related to a separate recall of more than 100m air bags made by Takata, which has affected more than a dozen automotive firms and has been linked to several fatalities.	O	O
The models affected by Toyota’s new airbag problem are sold widely across Europe and out of the 141,000 vehicles affected across the continent, nearly a quarter are British.	O	O
The world’s largest automaker said last month that it expects to take a $1.47bn hit for the year ending in March 2017 on “quality-related expenses”.	O	O
The Netherlands has the second largest number of cars being recalled (22,319) in Europe, followed by France with 15,260.	O	O
Elsewhere, 743,000 vehicles in Japan, 495,000 in North America, 9,000 in China and 46,000 in other regions are being recalled.	O	O
All of the 72,885 UK vehicles affected were manufactured between April 2006 and August 2015, with those recalled over airbag concerns produced between October 2008 and August 2012.	O	O
Customers can check whether their vehicle is affected using a registration look-up function in the owners’ section of the main Toyota and Lexus websites, and a recall helpline has been set up.	O	O
Vehicle inspections and repairs will be provided at no charge, Toyota said.	O	O
Toyota is no stranger to taking millions of vehicles off the road, having been forced into two recalls in 2009 and 2010 affecting 9m vehicles.	O	O
The scandal followed a string of fatal crashes that occurred when Toyota accelerator pedals got stuck.	O	O
Toyota eventually reached a $1.2bn settlement with the US Justice Department that saw it admit concealing information about the problem.	O	O

Toyota recalls 1.4 million cars for airbag problem
Toyota is recalling 1.4 million cars worldwide for a problems with exploding airbags.	O	O
Though Toyota said this recall does not involve a Takata airbag, it has not identified the supplier.	O	O
Toyota said it is not aware of any deaths or injuries related to this latest airbag recall.	O	O
It also said the cause of the problem, and the solution, is different from the Takata problem.	O	O
In this recall, the airbags are on the side of the car, not the steering wheel or passenger-side dashboard.	O	O
These airbags have inflators composed of two chambers that are welded together.	O	O
Toyota (TM) said when the car is parked and unoccupied for a period of time, that weld can develop a crack and the two chambers can separate, causing the airbag to inflate and some pieces of the inflator to shoot into the car.	O	O
The models involved in the recall include three hybrid models, the Prius, the Prius Plug-in and the Lexus CT200h produced between October 2008 and April 2012.	O	O
Nearly 500,000 of the 1.4 million cars being recalled are in the U.S.	O	O
Takata airbags are the focus of the largest auto recall in history, with more than a dozen different automakers forced to recall cars with its products installed -- including Toyota.	O	O
There are 69 million Takata airbags that have been recalled or will be recalled by 2019 in the United States alone.	O	O
The Takata airbags need to be recalled because the inflators can rupture, sending shrapnel into the driver or front seat passenger.	O	O
At least ten U.S. deaths have been linked to exploding Takata airbags, along with dozens of serious injuries.	O	O

Autoliv Inc. of Sweden saw its shares slip Wednesday after revealing it supplied air bags that prompted Toyota Motor Corp. to recall 1.4 million cars.
Shares in Autoliv Inc. slid over 5% Wednesday after it revealed itself to be the company behind a recall by Toyota Motor Corp. of 1.4 million vehicles because of a possible air-bag defect.	O	O
The Swedish maker of air bags and safety belts said it is working with Toyota in a voluntary recall of Prius and Lexus CT200h models, some of which have experienced partial inflation of air bags.	O	O
“Seven incidents involving the Toyota Prius have been reported where a side curtain air bag has partially inflated without a deployment signal being given by the air bag controller,” Autoliv said in a statement.	O	O
“In each of those incidents, the vehicles were parked and unoccupied, and there have been no reported injuries.	O	O
”Earlier Wednesday, Toyota announced it was recalling the vehicles but said the problem wasn’t related to inflaters made by Japanese air-bag maker Takata Corp., which have been at the center of the largest automotive safety recall campaign to date.	O	O
Autoliv said it is still investigating the root cause of the issue but said the evidence points to vehicle-specific characteristics and a manufacturing issue as contributors.	O	O
Toyota said that in conjunction with regulatory bodies it has concluded that an additional retention bracket will address the issue.	O	O
Although it is too early to determine the final cost to Autoliv, the company said it currently expected to be at the lower end of a $10 million-$40 million range, net of expected insurance recoveries.	O	O

My grandfather, Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew
A delegation with the US Department of Justice has arrived in Ankara to hold talks over Turkey's request for extradition of a Muslim leader accused of masterminding a coup attempt last month, according to two senior Turkish officials.	O	O
The development marks the first concrete and public sign of progress in Turkey's efforts to get self-exiled Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based Turkish-born religious leader and businessman, returned to the country.	B	Turkey requests extradition of Fethullah Gülen
Turkey says that Gulen's supporters within the army carried out the failed coup of July 15, claiming that they have been running "a parallel state" within the civilian and military bureaucracy, and following their own agenda.	B	Fethullah Gülen
Gulen denies the claims.	O	O
Both officials told Al Jazeera that the US delegation would hold technical meetings with their counterparts in the Turkish Ministry of Justice and discuss the evidence presented to the US on Gulen's involvement in the attempted coup and other illegal activities.	O	O
The delegation arrived in Ankara on August 22 and meetings are scheduled for August 23 and 24.	O	O
Gulen has had court cases pending against him for several years and Turkey has been demanding his extradition well before the failed coup.	O	O
Following the July 15 incident, more court cases have been opened targeting him.	O	O
"We would like Gulen to be returned to Turkish justice, considering all the legal proceedings against him and the extradition treaty between Turkey and the US.	B	Fethullah Gülen
We see any step towards this goal positively," a senior Turkish official told Al Jazeera.	I	Fethullah Gülen
Yasin Aktay, the deputy chairman of the ruling Justice and Development Party, told Al Jazeera that during the meetings, the US delegation was expected to seek clarifications on the evidence presented by Turkey to the US concerning Gulen's network.	O	O
"It is bizarre for us that they [the US] have not been convinced, considering the scope of evidence we presented to them.	O	O
Even this meeting should not have been necessary," Aktay said.	O	O
"The testimony of the suspects who were arrested red-handed and documents we gave them are clear.	O	O
If you add the statements of Gulen regarding the goal of his organisational movement, we believe there is nothing to question.	O	O
Strong American intelligence should be well aware of who he really is.	O	O
"The reluctance of Washington to return Gulen is perceived in Turkey as an effort to protect him, supporting the view that there are no terrorists, but only allies for the US.	O	O
"Angry toneTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other high level officials have appealed to the US for the return of Gulen numerous times.	O	O
Erdogan adopted an angry tone towards Turkey's ally various times, saying that the US "had to choose between Turkey and Gulen".	O	O
Rebel soldiers bombed state buildings, including the parliament and the presidential palace, during the coup attempt, killing civilians and security forces.	O	O
At least 290 people, including the plotters, were killed during the events of July 15.	O	O
Tens of thousands of civilian and military state employees were sacked or detained following the incident in efforts to get rid of the followers of Gulen, seen as a terrorist organisation in Turkey.	O	O
Police have also raided allegedly Gulen-linked businesses and media networks across the country and arrested various suspects allegedly linked to these organisations.	O	O

Turkish prosecutors seek 2 life sentences for Gulen
Prosecutors in western Turkey have demanded a life sentence for U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey accuses of masterminding the failed coup in the country, the state-run news agency reported Tuesday.	B	Fethullah Gülen
Concluding a yearlong investigation into his movement’s financial dealings, prosecutors in the city of Usak demanded that Gulen be punished with two life sentences plus 1,900 years in prison, the Anadolu Agency reported.	O	O
In the more than 2,500-page indictment accepted by the court in Usak on Tuesday, Gulen and 111 other suspects are accused of transferring funds obtained through charities or donations to the United States via “front” companies, Anadolu said.	O	O
It said the indictment also makes reference to Gulen’s alleged role in the July 15 coup.	O	O
Gulen, a former Erdogan ally who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania, is already on trial in absentia in Turkish courts, facing life terms over accusations of plotting to overthrow the government and leading an armed group.	O	O
He has also been indicted on a charge of leading a terror organization and faces another trial in absentia in November.	O	O
On Tuesday, police in Istanbul launched simultaneous raids on 44 companies suspected of providing financial support to Gulen’s movement while authorities issued warrants to detain 120 company executives, Anadolu reported.	O	O
The private Dogan news agency said the companies searched included a supermarket chain.	O	O
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has refused to rule out bringing back the death penalty in order to punish the coup plotters — a move that would further jeopardize Turkey’s faltering European Union membership bid.	O	O
But on Tuesday, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim appeared to move away from reinstating capital punishment.	O	O
“Anyone who spilled the blood of our martyrs will be held to account.	B	Fethullah Gülen
But, my valuable citizens, we won’t act in the spirit of vengeance,” Yildirim said during his weekly address to his ruling party’s legislators.	O	O
“Death penalty is death for one time.	O	O
But there are worse ways of dying.	O	O
This is through an objective and fair trial.	O	O
”On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu held a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to discuss an upcoming visit by Vice President Joe Biden, as well as Turkey’s demand that Gulen be extradited, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.	O	O
The two also discussed recent developments in Syria.	O	O
Meanwhile, Turkey made a formal request to Greece for the extradition of eight Turkish officers who fled to the neighboring country after last month’s attempted coup, the state-run news agency reported.	O	O
A Justice Ministry file had been delivered to Greece requesting the officers’ return over charges that include breaching the Constitution through the use of force, plotting to kill the president and crimes against the parliament and government, Anadolu reported.	O	O
The six pilots and two engineers fled to Greece aboard a military helicopter after the July 15 attempt.	O	O
Turkey wants them returned to stand trial on charges of participating in the violent attempt by renegade officers within the Turkish military that resulted in at least 270 deaths.	O	O
Parliament was bombed, while Erdogan escaped an attack on his hotel at a seaside resort.	O	O
The eight deny involvement in the coup and have applied for asylum, saying they fear for their safety amid widespread purges in the aftermath of the attempted overthrow of the government.	O	O
The government says the coup was the work of followers of Gulen’s religious movement, who allegedly have infiltrated the military over the years.	O	O
The government declared a state of emergency and launched a massive crackdown on Gulen’s supporters in the aftermath of the coup, raising concerns among European nations and human rights organizations who have urged restraint.	O	O
Some 35,000 people have been detained for questioning and more than 17,000 of them have been formally arrested to face trial, including soldiers, police, judges and journalists.	O	O
Tens of thousands more people with suspected links to Gulen have been suspended or dismissed from their jobs in the judiciary, media, education, health care, military and local government.	O	O
Gulen has denied any prior knowledge or involvement in the coup.	O	O

Turkey requests extradition of Fethullah Gülen but not for coup attempt, says US
The US has confirmed it has received a formal extradition request from Ankara for the Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen, but not over the July coup attempt the Turkish authorities has accused Gülen of orchestrating.	O	O
The state department’s announcement came after US officials met their Turkish counterparts in Ankara to discuss Gülen, who has lived in rural Pennsylvania for the past 17 years in self-imposed exile.	O	O
Vice-president Joe Biden is expected in the Turkish capital on Wednesday to meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.	O	O
According to the White House, Biden will emphasise “ongoing strong support” for Turkish democracy in the wake of the foiled coup by a segment of the armed forces, but the Turkish leader is expected to focus his attention on the Muslim cleric, who was once his ally but whose presence in the US has now become a serious irritant in relations between Washington and Ankara.

Erdoğan has previously warned the Obama administration it had to “choose between Turkey and Gülen”.	O	O
“We can confirm now that Turkey has requested the extradition of Gülen,” a state department spokesman, Mark Toner, told journalists on Tuesday.	O	O
Toner added that the extradition request was not related to the 15 July attempted coup, but was for other issues for which Gülen was being sought by authorities in Ankara.	O	O
He did not specify what those issues were.	O	O
Fethullah Gülen: alleged coup mastermind – and friendly neighbor	O	O
Erdoğan’s government has blamed Gülen for orchestrating the abortive putsch, in which over 200 people were killed, and has rounded up his alleged supporters.	O	O
Ten of thousands of suspected Gülen supporters have been dismissed from jobs in the judiciary, armed services or media, and many have been imprisoned.	O	O
Earlier this months, the state department said that it had received a sheaf of documents from Turkey about Gülen, but could not confirm at that time the documents amounted to an extradition request.	O	O
Any such request and US response, they said, would be governed by the extradition treaty both countries signed in 1981.	O	O
From the US, Gülen has run an extensive social network in Turkey, promoting interfaith dialogue and providing social services.	O	O
It operated in partnership with Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP) until the relationship between the two men soured in 2012 and then turned to enmity the following year, when a corruption scandal erupted implicating the president’s closest associates and family.	O	O
Erdoğan blamed Gülen for planting the allegations.	O	O
The Turkish government has since described the Gülen movement as a terrorist organisation.	B	Fethullah Gülen

"These were obviously the condemnation of the coup attempt, solidarity with the Turkish people and also an acknowledgement that super powers and other international players should have been present to show their solidarity with Turkey after the coup attempt.	B	Turkey

The US Department of Justice will dispatch a team to Turkey in the coming days to pursue allegations by the Turkish government of criminal activity by Fethullah Gulen, according to a US media report.	O	O
If true, the move, first reported on Friday by Bloomberg News citing a US administration official, would mark the first sign of progress in Turkey's attempts to have the Pennsylvania-based Turkish-born religious leader extradited.	O	O
The government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Gulen's network of being behind a coup attempt last month, a charge he has strenuously denied.	B	Fethullah Gülen
"Sooner or later, the US will make a choice.	O	O
Either Turkey or FETO," Erdogan said last week, referring to Gulen.	O	O
However, the Washington Post newspaper, quoting an official at the US justice department, reported on Friday that the extradition request refers only to alleged activities before the failed coup attempt.	O	O
"It's actually tied to allegations of certain alleged criminal activities that pre-date the coup," the official said.	O	O
"At this point, Turkish authorities have not put forward a formal extradition request based on evidence that he was involved in the coup.	O	O
"US officials are "working alongside their Turkish counterparts to make sure we understand everything contained in the evidence", according to the justice department official.	O	O
"If there is probable cause for extradition, ultimately a court will determine whether the evidence is sufficient.	O	O
.	O	O
We are still a way down the line from even knowing whether that's possible.	B	extradition of Fethullah Gülen
"US officials have said that even if the justice department decides extradition is warranted, a court case and possible appeals could take several years.	O	O
Arrests in AzerbaijanIn another development on Friday, officials in Azerbaijan said they had arrested four men over suspected ties to Gulen.	O	O
The four are accused of an "abuse of power" while working for a mobile phone company for having passed on private information about subscribers and their call history, Azeri prosecutors said.	O	O
During a search of the home of one of the accused, investigators discovered "religious literature, disks, brochures containing speeches by Fethullah Gulen and other documents", they said in a statement.	O	O
A close ally of Turkey, Azerbaijan earlier this week opened a criminal investigation into supporters of Gulen.	O	O
Azerbaijan last month shut down a private television channel over plans to broadcast an interview with Gulen, "in order to avoid provocations aimed at damaging the strategic partnership between Turkey and Azerbaijan".	O	O
Reports from DenmarkThe Azeri move came shortly after Danish media reported that hundreds of Turks in Denmark had withdrawn their children from schools with alleged links to Gulen.	O	O
A document circulating on Facebook listed 14 private schools in Denmark as being linked to Gulen and urged parents to "Save your children from Fethullah Gulen's terror organisation's schools", according to a translation from Turkish by broadcaster TV 2.	O	O
A total of 366 students had been pulled out of the schools after the summer break, the broadcaster said.	O	O
Gulen's Hizmet organisation has affiliated schools around the world, including in the former Soviet Kazakhstan, normally funded by wealthy Turkish businessmen.	O	O

The department has confirmed that it has been working through those documents, but Toner could not say whether at the time the documents amounted to an extradition request.	O	O
Yet, he did stress that the State Department’s response would be within the 1981 extradition treaty with Turkey and that the US “would acknowledge” once a formal request is filed.	O	O
The US has previously refused to hand over the cleric, saying Turkey would need to provide “evidence, not allegations” against Gulen, in order to have him extradited.	O	O
Toner’s statement comes right on the eve of Vice President Joe Biden’s visit to Turkey, where he is expected to meet the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.	O	O

Turkey to free 38,000 people from prisons to make space for alleged coup plotters
Turkey has issued a decree paving the way for the conditional release of 38,000 prisoners in an apparent move to make jail space for thousands of people who have been arrested after last month’s failed coup.	O	O
The decree allows the release of inmates who have two years or less to serve of their prison terms and makes convicts who have served half of their term eligible for parole.	O	O
Some prisoners are excluded: people convicted of murder, domestic violence, sexual abuse or terrorism and other crimes against the state.	O	O
The measures would not apply for crimes committed after 1 July.	O	O
The justice minister, Bekir Bozdağ, said the move would lead to the release of 38,000 people, adding it was not a pardon or an amnesty but a conditional release of prisoners.	O	O
The government says the coup attempt on 15 July, which led to at least 270 deaths, was carried out by followers of the movement led by the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen who have infiltrated the military and other state institutions.	O	O
Gülen has denied any prior knowledge or involvement in the coup but Turkey is demanding that the US extradite him.	O	O

China's second-largest telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp is now operating normally and is evaluating the impact on the company posed by a US Commerce Department decision, the company said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Sunday.	O	O
ZTE said it has noted some media reports saying that the company faces US export restrictions.	O	O
Reuters reported Saturday that the US Commerce Department is set to place export restrictions on ZTE for allegedly selling embargoed US technology products to Iran.	O	O
ZTE closely complies with international industry rules as well as the laws of foreign countries, the statement said.	B	China's ZTE
Experts said that the restrictions will have more effect on US product makers than on ZTE.	B	U.S. Commerce Department to place restrictions on China's ZTE
US suppliers are required under that country's restrictions to apply for an export license before shipping any US-made equipment or parts to ZTE, which will make it hard for the Chinese company to purchase US products, according to the Reuters report.	B	U.S. Commerce Department to place restrictions on China's ZTE
The license applications will generally be denied, said a notice that will be released by the US Commerce Department sometime this week, the report noted.	O	O
The restrictions will take effect on Tuesday, Reuters noted, and they will apply to any company across the world that wants to ship US-made products to ZTE.	B	U.S. Commerce Department to place restrictions on China's ZTE
ZTE can appeal the action, according to Reuters.	O	O
The restriction will have a limited impact on the domestic telecommunications titan as its US suppliers are limited, Zhang Yi, CEO of iiMedia Research Institute, a mobile Internet consulting agency, told the Global Times on Sunday.	B	U.S. Commerce Department to place restrictions on China's ZTE
It seems that US product makers will be affected more than the Chinese company, Zhang noted.	B	U.S.
"Given the current economic situation in the US, the country is eager to sell its products and technology to the world and ZTE is one of its big clients that will provide good profits to these US firms," he said.	I	U.S.
Fu Liang, a Beijing-based IT expert, agreed with Zhang's view, saying that the Chinese company is interdependent with the US product makers, not only in terms of parts and products, but also technology.	O	O
"As ZTE sells its telecom equipment and terminal machines to the US market, the business, to some extent, will also be affected due to the Commerce Department's decision," Fu told the Global Times on Sunday.	B	China's ZTE
The US Commerce Department launched investigations into ZTE's alleged violation of US export controls on Iran following media reports in 2012 that "the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of America's best-known tech firms to Iran's largest telecom carrier, Telecommunication Co of Iran (TCI)," Reuters said.	O	O
The US product producers, including Microsoft Corp, IBM, Oracle Corp and Dell Inc, have all said they were not aware of ZTE's contract with TCI, Reuters said.	O	O
It is not clear if any of these companies still do business with ZTE, said the report.	O	O
ZTE will no longer seek new customers in Iran and limit business activities with existing customers, according to a statement released in March 2012 on the company's website, right after media reports said the company shipped US-made technology products to Iran despite US sanctions on the country.	B	China's ZTE
Subsequently, ZTE Chairman Hou Weigui said that the company had halted business in Iran, although it had to continue to provide services for products previously sold to customers in the country, the Xinhua News Agency reported in April 2013.	B	China's ZTE

VW engineer pleads guilty in emissions fraud
A veteran Volkswagen engineer faces up to 5 years in prison and fines of at least $250,000 for his role in the diesel emissions scandal.	O	O
A veteran Volkswagen engineer pleaded guilty Friday in the first criminal charges stemming from the Justice Department’s yearlong investigation into the company’s rigging of federal air-pollution tests.	O	O
James Liang appeared in U.S.	O	O
District Court in Detroit and pledged to cooperate with investigators in hopes of seeking a lighter sentence.	O	O
Liang, 62, worked in Volkswagen's Wolfsburg, Germany, headquarters in diesel engine development, and later the United States, and accepted responsibility for defrauding the government.	O	O
In an agreement filed with the court, Liang pleaded to conspiracy to defraud U.S. regulators and Volkswagen customers, wire fraud, and violations of the U.S.	O	O
Clean Air Act.	O	O
He faces up to 5 years in prison and fines of at least $250,000.	O	O
The emissions scandal has rocked one of the world's largest automakers and tarnished an image that was largely built on its ability to make and sell fuel-efficient diesel engines, leading to a shake-up of its highest ranking executives.	B	emissions scandal
Earlier this summer, Volkswagen reached a settlement with U.S. regulators and California under which the automaker agreed to pay $16.5 billion to owners, dealerships and regulators.	O	O
Liang, of Newberry Park, Calif., appeared in court Friday with a German language translator, but said in English he was a Volkswagen engineer who worked on an engine that "did not meet U.S. emission standards," by surpassing the emissions limits of nitrous oxide in about 500,000 cars — including models of the Jetta, Golf, Beetle, Passat, and Audi A3 — sold in the United States.	O	O
He also admitted to using software that would make the engines seem to pass emissions tests, when in reality, they did not.	O	O
Liang worked for Volkswagen, starting in 1983, and moved to the United States in 2008, about two years after Justice Department officials said the conspiracy began.	O	O
In the indictment, which had been sealed until Friday, the government said Volkswagen told customers that the vehicles were clean diesel and emitted less pollutants under stricter emission standards.	O	O
In fact, those vehicles were equipped with a defeat device — referred to by a variety of names such as "acoustic function," "switch logic," "cycle beating" software and "emissions-tight mode" — that had been installed in the vehicles causing them to emit far more emissions than allowed.	O	O
Liang, along with other former and current Volkswagen employees, worked from 2006 to 2015 to defraud the United States and customers, according to the indictment.	O	O
"Liang and his co-conspirators knew that if they had told the truth and disclosed the existence of the defeat device, VW could not have sold any of its diesel vehicles in the United States," the indictment said.	B	Volkswagen engineer pleads guilty to conspiracy in emissions scandal
By 2014, the indictment alleges, older models of the engine began to age, and the company began to see higher warranty claims.	O	O
To fix the problem, the indictment said, Liang and others said the cars needed a software update, which would use the angle of the steering wheel to more easily detect when the vehicle was undergoing an emissions test, which improved the defeat device's precision to reduce stress on the emission control system.	O	O
Discrepancies in emissions results from vehicles on the road and those being tested, however, were detected in 2014 by the West Virginia University's Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines and Emissions.	O	O
In the indictment, the government said that Liang and others continued to conceal the existence of the software, and suggested a voluntary recall to fix problems.	O	O
Liang, who is not a United States citizen, declined to comment after the court proceeding.	O	O
His Los Angeles-based attorney, Daniel Nixon, said his client has come to court to accept responsibility, is full of remorse for what he had done, and is "one of many who got caught up" in the situation.	B	Volkswagen engineer
Liang's sentencing is set for Jan. 11.	O	O

Volkswagen engineer pleads guilty to conspiracy in emissions scandal
Volkswagen engineer James Liang pleaded guilty on Friday to one count of conspiracy in the company’s emissions cheating scandal and has agreed to cooperate in the widening criminal investigation.	B	conspiracy in emissions scandal
This is the first criminal charge in the justice department’s year-long investigation into the company’s rigging of federal air pollution tests.	O	O
US finds evidence Volkswagen acted criminally in emissions scandal – report	O	O
VW previously admitted to cheating on US diesel emissions tests for several years after researchers found about 500,000 of its cars contained a software that would reduce emissions while the car was undergoing a government-administered emissions test.	O	O
When the car was on the road and the cheat device was turned off, the cars emitted up to 40 times the legal limit for nitrogen oxide, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.	O	O
Such levels can cause respiratory problems.	O	O
VW agreed to pay $15.3bn to its customers and regulators in July.	O	O
The settlement did not preclude criminal charges.	O	O
“We will follow the facts wherever they go and we will determine whether to bring criminal charges against any companies or individual wrongdoers,” Sally Yates, US deputy attorney general, said at the time.	O	O
Liang pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud against US regulators and customers and to violating the Clean Air Act.	O	O
He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison.	O	O
By cooperating with the government, he could potentially reduce his prison sentence.	O	O
Liang worked at Volkswagen since 1983, beginning in Germany and then moving to the US in 2008 – two years after the government says the conspiracy began.	O	O
He was part of the team of engineers working on the diesel engine at the center of the emissions tests cheating scandal.	O	O
The 62-year-old appeared in Detroit federal court with a translator.	O	O
His sentence is not expected to be announced until January.	O	O
Liang’s plea comes just a day after Vermont’s attorney general, William Sorrell, said the settlement reached over the summer was inadequate and announced that Vermont was bringing its own lawsuit against VW’s affiliates.	O	O
“This was not a mistake.	B	emissions scandal
This was not a ‘whoops’ situation,” Sorrell said on Thursday.	I	emissions scandal
“This was intentional fraud on a massive scale.	I	emissions scandal
”The lawsuit seeks penalties for violations of Vermont’s environmental and consumer laws.	B	emissions scandal
The company addressed the suit: “To date, Volkswagen has agreed to buy back or modify affected 2.0L TDI vehicles, establish a $2.7 bn environmental remediation trust, for which Vermont is eligible to receive $17.8m, and invest $2bn for infrastructure and awareness to increase the use of zero emission vehicles across the United States.	O	O
”By the end of August, about 210,000 of the 475,000 owners of affected VW cars have registered to settle with the company as part of the $15bn settlement.	O	O
According to the attorneys working on the class-action suit, only 235 people have opted out of the settlement to pursue legal action on their own.	O	O
“Volkswagen is continuing to cooperate with the US Department of Justice.	O	O
We cannot comment on this indictment,” the company said in a statement.	O	O
A final decision on the settlement is expected on 18 October.	O	O
Recent sales figures show VW sales dropped 9% compared with last August.	O	O

Volkswagen engineer pleads guilty to criminal charges in emissions cheating case
A Volkswagen engineer pleaded guilty to U.S. federal charges for his role in the diesel emission cheating scandal.	B	conspiracy in emissions scandal
James Robert Liang, 62, who worked at Volkswagen for more than 30 years, faces up to five years in federal prison.	O	O
They were the first U.S. criminal charges in the Volkswagen (VLKAF) case, where the company sold about 500,000 cars loaded with software that cut back on pollution during emissions testing.	O	O
The same cars emitted up to 40 times the allowed level of various pollutants when actually driven.	O	O
Liang has agreed to cooperate with the investigation of other Volkswagen employees.	O	O
He might also have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.	O	O
"Volkswagen is continuing to cooperate with the U.S.	O	O
Department of Justice.	O	O
We cannot comment on this indictment," said VW spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan.	O	O
Liang, a German citizen, helped to develop the so-called "clean diesel" engine for Volkswagen while working in Germany.	O	O
According to court documents, he and his co-conspirators realized they could not design a diesel engine that would meet the stricter U.S. emissions standards.	O	O
So they designed and implemented software to cheat the tests.	O	O
In 2008, Liang moved to the United States to help win regulatory approval of the diesel engines.	O	O
He attended meetings with environmental regulators and answered questions about the engines' test results, knowing that that were false, according to the court documents.	O	O
He faces being deported once he serves his prison term.	O	O
Volkswagen has admitted that its cars contained the illegal software.	O	O
The company still faces a U.S. criminal probe.	O	O
Volkswagen says its own probe has determined top executives did not know of the cheating scandal, and that it was the work of lower level employees.	O	O
But the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts have filed a suit accusing top executives of engaging in a "massive fraud" to break environmental laws.	O	O
The company also has agreed to pay $15.3 billion in civil penalties to compensate owners of its U.S. diesel cars, including an agreement to fix or buy back the cars.	O	O

He is the first to be charged as part of the US Justice Department's year-long criminal probe into the firm's rigging of federal air-pollution tests.	O	O

Second hand Volkswagens 'holding their value'
Second hand Volkswagens appear to be holding their value well, a motoring magazine says, despite the emissions scandal which emerged a year ago.	B	Volkswagen
Industry magazine What Car says prices of VW models have not collapsed as might have been expected.	O	O
VW cars which are three years old, or have done 36,000 miles, are typically worth 42.21% of their original value, the magazine said.	O	O
That is 2.7% lower than in September 2015, just before the scandal broke.	O	O
However, across the industry as a whole, second hand values have fallen by 2% over the same timeframe, suggesting that Volkswagens have performed only slightly worse than the average car on the market.	O	O
Software switch"I'm sure there are motorists out there who were rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of used VW prices falling off a cliff because of the emissions debacle," said What Car editor Steve Huntingford.	O	O
"That simply hasn't come to pass, however, and while the VW story continues to rumble on a year after the story first came to light, the Golf and Polo are still among the most popular new cars in the UK.	O	O
"The German car-maker admitted on 16 September last year that software had switched diesel engines to a "clean mode" whenever they were tested for emissions.	O	O
VW has recalled 200,000 cars in the UK as a result.	O	O
But while it is offering to repair them, it is not offering owners compensation.	O	O
VW drivers in the US have been offered up to $10,000 each to make up for the deception.	O	O
The What Car research suggested that cars made by VW under the Audi brand experienced a similar drop in value to VW-badged cars over the past year.	O	O
It also found that the value of second hand Seat and Skoda models, also made by the VW group, fell by less than 0.5% over the 12-month period.	O	O

Someone Is Actually Facing Jail Time For Volkswagen\u2019s Pollution Scandal
A Volkswagen engineer pleaded guilty to conspiring to cheat on U.S. emissions tests and agreed to work with federal prosecutors to investigate the German automaker, the U.S.	B	conspiracy in emissions scandal
Department of Justice announced Friday.	O	O
James Liang \u2015 a 25-year veteran of the company’s plant in Wolfsburg, Germany \u2015 helped develop the device that allowed the diesel-fueled Jetta sedan to beat emissions tests in 2006.	O	O
Volkswagen became embroiled in scandal last September when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that nearly 482,000 cars in the United States violated emissions standards set by the Clean Air Act.	O	O
Liang’s plea marks the first criminal conviction from series of probes that began last year after Volkswagen admitted to programming roughly 11 million cars worldwide to circumvent emissions tests.	B	Volkswagen engineer pleads guilty to conspiracy in emissions scandal
Liang, 62, could face up to five years in prison, according to the Financial Times.	O	O
The conviction is sure to rock an auto industry that has repeatedly hoodwinked customers into buying faulty or dangerous vehicles \u2015 infractions that haven’t led to anyone spending time in jail.	O	O
The day before the Volkswagen scandal erupted last year, General Motors admitted to criminal wrongdoing and agreed to pay a $900 million penalty for mishandling a defective ignition switch.	O	O
The faulty hardware, which caused the engine to shut off during driving, has been linked to at least 124 deaths.	O	O
“People were hurt and people died in our cars,” Mary T.	O	O
Barra, GM’s chief executive, said at the time.	O	O
The company entered a deferred prosecution agreement, which allows the government to drop the case in three years if GM abides the terms of the deal.	O	O
But no individual executives faced criminal charges.	O	O
In 2014, Toyota agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine to avoid prosecution for covering up safety risks from parts that caused “unintended acceleration” in cars for about a decade leading up to 2009.	O	O
The defect led to at least 89 deaths.	O	O
No individual executives faced criminal charges then either.	O	O
Volkswagen’s deception may have caused some deaths, too.	O	O
The automaker’s cars spewed up to 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxides, which comes from burning diesel.	O	O
The resultant emissions may have led to at least 60 premature deaths in the U.S. alone, according to a peer-reviewed study published last October in the journal Environmental Research Letters.	O	O

In 2006, he and his "co-conspirators" started work on a new diesel engine for U.S. vehicles, the plea agreement says.	O	O
As described in a 25-page indictment unsealed Friday along with the plea deal, Liang and the other VW employees at Volkswagen knew "from almost the beginning of VW's process to design its new 'clean diesel' vehicles" that the cars "would not meet U.S. emissions standards.	O	O
"When they realized that they could not design an engine that would adhere to the strict U.S. standards, while also delivering solid road performance, they created and implemented so-called defeat devices — software that could recognize when cars were being tested "in order to cheat" the tests, according to court papers.	O	O
If the software detected the vehicle was undergoing a test, it told the car to emit only enough nitrogen oxide to pass the inspection.	O	O
Otherwise, the court papers allege, it permitted the cars to pump substantially more nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere.	O	O
Volkswagen said in a statement that it is "continuing to cooperate with the U.S.	O	O
Department of Justice," but couldn't comment on the indictment.	O	O
In 2008, Liang transferred to the U.S. to help launch Volkswagen's new "clean diesel" vehicles, according to the plea agreement.	O	O
While working at VW's test facility in Oxnard, he served as "leader of diesel competence.	O	O
"According to court papers, Liang and his fellow engineers did not stop at creating the defeat devices — they improved them.	O	O
Engineers believed that the surge in warranty claims was "a result of the vehicle operating in 'testing mode' too long rather than switching to 'road mode,' " prosecutors wrote.	O	O
To blunt the claims, Liang and his fellow employees upgraded the defeat device to help cars better recognize when they no longer were being tested.	O	O
Volkswagen then pushed the software update out to unwitting customers, claiming that it was intended to improve their cars and never mentioning that it was partly to cheat emissions tests.	O	O
The German automaker will spend up to $10 billion to buy back or modify VW and Audi 2.0-liter diesel vehicles in the U.S.	O	O
It also will pay $2.7 billion into a trust to support environmental programs and reduce emissions.	O	O
The settlement was reached with the Justice Department, state attorneys general and other agencies, as well as car owners.	O	O

In a surprise televised address on Tuesday night, Modi said the demonetisation of India’s highest-value banknotes, worth about £6 and £12, would start from midnight.	O	O
