Kuwait oil unions end 3-day strike over government cutbacks
Oil unions in Kuwait ended a three-day strike over government cutbacks, authorities said Wednesday, though it remained unclear what concessions may have been granted to the workers amid low global crude prices.	O	O
The state-run Kuwait News Agency reported that the unions ended the strike by praising the country’s ruling emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, and saying their action showed their “ability to affect the production process.	O	O
”The unions “entrusted his highness, the emir, (with) the protection of rights of the employees in the oil sector,” the unions said, according to KUNA.	O	O
It said workers wouldn’t be disciplined for taking part in the strike.	O	O
Adel al-Fadhel, a spokesman for the Kuwait Oil Company Workers’ Union, confirmed workers would go back to work Wednesday.	O	O
He said Sheikh Sabah spoke to the head of one of the unions Tuesday by telephone to assure his support for the workers.	O	O
“We’re glad to announce that the strike has succeeded in preserving the rights of the workers in the oil sector,” al-Fadhel told The Associated Press.	B	strike
“His highness, the emir, intervened and guaranteed to preserve the rights of the workers according to the law.	O	O
”Al-Fadhel did not elaborate.	O	O
The emir’s court later denied Kuwait’s ruler spoke to any union official regarding the strike.	B	strike
Al-Fadhel declined to immediate comment on the denial.	O	O
Workers began the strike Sunday over cuts in their pay and benefits packages after failing to reach an agreement with the Oil Ministry.	B	strike
Kuwait, an OPEC member, on average pumps 3 million barrels of oil a day.	O	O
It may take Kuwait as many as three days to regain that production, government oil spokesman Sheikh Talal al-Khaled Al Sabah said in a KUNA report, an acknowledgment that the strike did affect output.	B	strike
The strike slightly cut into the oil glut now facing the global market, lessening the impact of oil producers failing to reach a freeze agreement this weekend during a meeting in Doha, Qatar.	B	strike
With production now likely to rise with the workers returning to the fields, benchmark U.S. crude fell 95 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $41.53 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.	O	O

Over 7,000 oil and gas workers have ended a three-day strike to protest government plans to cut wages and benefits, according to local newspaper reports.	B	strike
The strike has cut Kuwait’s oil production by almost half.	O	O

“In honor of His Highness the Emir, on the basis of the principle of love and loyalty to His Highness, we decided to cancel the strike,” the statement concluded.	I	strike
The end of the strike was announced just hours after Kuwait’s acting oil minister, Anas al-Saleh, refused to negotiate until the workers had returned to their jobs, adding that oil production would continue.	O	O
“We cannot sit down at the negotiating table with the unions during a strike.	O	O
We will achieve the impossible to continue to operate the oil sector despite the strike,” Saleh told Kuwaiti TV channel al-Rai.	O	O

Oil down but off lows as Kuwait strike offsets failed output freeze
Oil prices slid on Monday after a plan by major oil producers to freeze production was scuttled, but a Kuwaiti oil industry strike helped the market pare losses and settle off the day’s lows.	O	O
The strike crippled more than 60 percent of Kuwait’s crude output, lending support to price benchmarks such as Brent and Dubai.	O	O
[nL3N17L282]Brent tumbled as much as 7 percent earlier on Monday after oil majors from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC Russia failed to reach agreement on a plan to freeze output at a meeting in Doha, Qatar.	O	O
[nL5N17K02F]“The material loss in production from the Kuwait strike has helped the oil market forget about the farce from Doha,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at the New York-headquartered Clipperdata.	O	O
Brent settled down 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $42.91 a barrel.	O	O
It had fallen $3 earlier in the session.U.S. crude’s West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark closed down 58 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $39.78 a barrel, after sliding to $37.61 at the day’s low.	O	O
While fallout from the Doha plan could weigh on a nascent recovery in oil prices, the market may not tumble as much as it did earlier this year, when Brent hit 12-year lows of around $27 in late January, some analysts said.	O	O
“Gradually declining non-OPEC production as well as planned maintenance in the face of resilient oil demand in Q1 have recently pointed to improving oil fundamentals,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note, referring to the first quarter.	O	O
A weakening dollar and the mostly steady climb in global equities since February have supported oil too.	O	O

N]“While a few forecasters may be dusting off some old $20 WTI expectations as a result of the Doha outcome, we expect solid support in nearby WTI at the $35 mark,” Jim Ritterbusch at Chicago oil consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates said.	O	O
Still, some investors piled on bearish options on U.S. crude, fearing the market may retest 2003 lows of around $26 struck in February.	O	O
Open interest in WTI’s June puts that allow the holder to sell at $35 per barrel hit a record high above 36,000, up 8 percent from Thursday and more than double levels seen in January.	O	O

Monsanto (MON), viewed as the bogeyman by some anti-genetically modified organism activists, may soon become an even bigger corporate entity.	B	Monsanto
Bayer, the German agrichemicals giant, has made an unsolicited takeover bid for America's Monsanto.	O	O
The offer was disclosed on Wednesday by Monsanto, which said its board of directors is currently reviewing the bid.	O	O
Together, the companies would have annual revenue of more than $67 billion and become the world's largest seed and crop-chemical provider.	O	O
The bid comes amid widespread challenges in the agribusiness industry, thanks to sliding commodity prices that's prompted a 19 percent plunge in Monsanto's share price over the past year.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
While Bayer may hope the companies could prove stronger together than as rivals, there are many hurdles to overcome before a deal could take place, including antitrust issues.	B	takeover offer
A merged Bayer-Monsanto would control about 28 percent of the world's pesticides, 36 percent of U.S. corn seeds, and 28 percent of soybean seeds, according to Dow Jones, citing Morgan Stanley estimates.	O	O
That may not go over well with either government regulators or consumers, especially given resistance among activists to Monsanto's GMOs and products like Roundup.	O	O
Monsanto has inspired hashtags such as #monsantoevil, with Modern Farmer magazine noting that the company had become "the face of corporate evil" in the views of some.	B	Monsanto
Antitrust issues could derail a potential merger, as well.	B	takeover offer
Monsanto failed to buy rival Syngenta last year after the pesticide maker rejected Monsanto's advances, arguing that the price was too low and that antitrust regulators wouldn't allow it.	B	takeover offer
That merger would have been valued at about $47 billion.	O	O
A price on a Bayer-Monsanto merger wasn't disclosed.	O	O
Still, it's likely that Bayer would have to offer a significant premium to succeed, with Bernstein analysts Jeremy Redenius and Ronny Gal pegging the amount at as much as $125 per share, or a roughly 29 percent premium to its closing price on Wednesday.	B	takeover offer
To get the deal completed, Bayer may have to sell assets, including its animal-health business and its stake in a plastics company, Bloomberg reported.	B	Bayer
Bayer may be hoping to snare Monsanto at a low point, given the company has cut its earnings forecast amid the commodity slump.	B	Bayer
Both companies are also facing a consolidation wave among rivals, such as China National Chemical Corp.'s successful pursuit of Syngenta after Monsanto ended its bid.	O	O
"Despite the ongoing consolidation in the agrochemicals market, we believe there is no need for Bayer to rush into a deal with Monsanto," Bankhaus Lampe KG analyst Volker Braun said in a research note, according to Bloomberg News.	B	Bayer

Bayer made an unsolicited $62 billion all-cash offer to acquire Monsanto to create the world’s biggest supplier of farm chemicals and genetically modified seeds, a proposed acquisition that would be the biggest corporate deal by a German company.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Bayer offered $122 per share in an all-cash bid in a May 10 written proposal, the Leverkusen-based company said in a statement on Monday.	O	O
That’s a 20 per cent premium to Monsanto’s last close in the US.	O	O
The offer will be funded with a combination of debt and equity, with about 25 per cent of the value of the transaction financed primarily through a rights issue.	O	O
“We have long respected Monsanto’s business and share their vision to create an integrated business that we believe is capable of generating substantial value for both companies’ shareholders,” Bayer Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann said in the statement.	B	Monsanto

Meanwhile DuPont and Dow Chemical plan to merge and then carve out a new crop-science unit.	O	O
Bayer expects total synergies from the deal of about $1.5 billion after the third year, the company said.	O	O

Germany's Bayer could tie up with US giant Monsanto
Germany's Bayer could tie up with US giant Monsanto German pharmaceuticals giant Bayer and US agricultural group Monsanto have said they are in talks on a possible merger to create a global player in pesticides and seeds, after weeks of speculation about a possible tie-up.	B	Bayer
"Bayer executives recently met with executives of Monsanto to privately discuss a negotiated acquisition of Monsanto Company," the Leverkusen-based company said in a statement.	O	O
Monsanto, for its part, "disclosed in response to recent media reports that it has received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from Bayer AG for a potential acquisition of Monsanto, subject to due diligence, regulatory approvals and other conditions.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
"Bayer shares were the biggest losers on the blue-chip DAX 30 index in Frankfurt following the announcement, plunging 7pc to an intraday low of €89.65 in an overall market down by around 1pc.	O	O
Both sides emphasised that the talks were still only exploratory at this stage, and neither mentioned how much any proposed deal would be worth.	O	O
"There is no assurance that any transaction will be entered into or consummated, or on what terms," Monsanto said, while Bayer insisted the talks were still only "preliminary" and "a further statement will be made as appropriate.	O	O
"     Low commodity prices have squeezed agricultural suppliers A combination would create a new giant in the seeds and pesticides sectors.	O	O
Agricultural suppliers such as Monsanto have been pressured by low commodity prices that have caused farmers to cut orders for supplies.	O	O
In March, Monsanto slashed its earnings forecast for 2016.	O	O
Sluggishness in the industry has also sparked deals such as a mega-merger between DuPont and Dow Chemical.	O	O
Switzerland's Syngenta last year rejected an unsolicited offer from Monsanto, later agreeing to be bought by China National Chemical for $43bn (£29bn).	O	O
Following its unsuccessful bid for Syngenta, Monsanto, which is based in Saint Louis, Missouri, embarked on a huge restructuring programme, axing 3,600 jobs, or 16pc of its workforce by 2018, closing sites and writing down assets.	O	O
Monsanto is a major manufacturer of agricultural seeds and herbicides and employs about 20,000 workers and it describes itself as one of the world's leading biotechnology companies.	B	Monsanto
"We produce seeds for fruits, vegetables and key crops - such as corn, soybeans, and cotton - that help farmers have better harvests while using water and other important resources more efficiently," the company said.	I	Monsanto
The US group has been in the headlines in Europe recently over the weedkiller glyphosate, which it markets under the name Roundup, and is suspected of causing cancer in humans and posing a serious risk to biodiversity.	O	O
The Wall Street Journal had quoted informed sources overnight that Bayer and Monsanto were in talks.	O	O
A report by Bloomberg News last week had fed similar speculation, evoking a purchase price of around $40bn, causing Monsanto shares to soar and Bayer shares to plummet.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Separate speculation of a possible tie-up between Monsanto and another German giant, BASF, has also done the rounds recently but has not so far been confirmed.	O	O
According to analysts at Deutsche Bank, Monsanto's management is seeking a purchase price of around $150 per share, which would represent a huge mark-up on the current share price of around $97.	B	Monsanto
The analysts therefore felt a deal was unlikely because of the price, as well as possible reservations on the part of the competition authorities towards a combination of Bayer and Monsanto.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Furthermore, analysts at Credit Suisse suggested that Bayer's financial firepower was "very limited" after it paid out €10bn for the prescription-free drugs business of US firm Merck in 2014, a deal that has not really fulfilled Bayer's expectations so far.	B	Bayer
Bayer, which employs around 117,000 workers, turned in record profits and sales in 2015, notching up net profit of €4.1bn on sales of €46.3bn euros.	O	O
"The proposed combination (with Monsanto) would reinforce Bayer as a global innovation-driven life science company with leadership positions in its core segments, and would create a leading integrated agriculture business," it argued.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
The German group recently floated its former material sciences division on the stock market under the name Covestro and reorganised its remaining pharmaceuticals (both prescription and non-prescription drugs) and agrochemicals operations.	O	O
It has also recently changed its chief executive, with Dutchman Marijn Dekkers stepping down early to take up a position at Unilever.	O	O
His successor Werner Baumann took over at the beginning of this month.	O	O

Last December, Dow Chemical and DuPont agreed to a $130 billion merger, after which the companies are expected to split into three separate businesses, including one focused on seeds and crop sprays, according to the Financial Times.	O	O

So in a reversal, the predator became prey.	O	O
Monsanto is unlikely to go down for less than it offered its former target.	B	Monsanto
Bayer’s bid for Monsanto appears big, but as The Wall Street Journal’s Helen Thomas pointed out on Monday, the offer isn’t as juicy as the one that wooed Syngenta to its Chinese state-owned rival: At 15.8 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, Bayer’s offer is hardly stingy.

In the biggest takeover ever attempted by a German company, Bayer said it made an offer for the American agrochemical giant at $122 per share in cash, or a total of $62 billion (55 billion euros).	O	O
The move spells a public relations risk for Bayer, especially in Germany, where popular scepticism is high of GM crops and the practice of patenting plant varieties, and where controversy has flared about the health risks of pesticide glyphosate which Monsanto markets as Roundup.

Bayer CEO Werner Baumann said the company would have to "decisively address the point of reputation and challenges of Monsanto in Europe", adding that "our brand stands for responsibility, transparency and openness".	B	Bayer
The German firm said it expected synergies from the merger -- the biggest announced this year to date in the world -- to boost annual earnings by around $1.5 billion after three years.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer

If Bayer acquires Monsanto, the deal would combine two of the world\u2019s biggest companies in the businesses of crop seeds and pesticides.
Bayer’s offer for Monsanto could be a triumph for an unfashionable corporate beast: the conglomerate.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Werner Baumann, the chief executive of the Germany-based Bayer, can only muster the $62 billion he needs to buy the American seed maker Monsanto because his own crop science business is backed by a large and successful health care arm, which makes up 63 percent of Bayer’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda.	I	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Mr. Baumann may see this as a benefit of being diversified.	I	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
For shareholders, however, it could turn out to be the opposite.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Monsanto shareholders are being offered almost $15 billion more for their equity than the company’s market value on May 9, the day before Bayer privately made its approach.	O	O
Because $47 billion of the total value of the deal will be funded in debt, it will leave the merged group with borrowings of four times its combined Ebitda.	O	O
But in reality, much of that debt is being loaded onto Bayer’s health care business.	O	O
If the crop science unit were buying Monsanto unaided, it would end up with net borrowings that were more than seven times combined Ebitda, which looks too high for comfort.	O	O
The risk is that Bayer’s options for making acquisitions in health care will be stunted.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Buying Monsanto could benefit one side of the business at the expense of the other.	I	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
If Bayer acquires Monsanto, the deal would combine two of the world’s biggest companies in the businesses of crop seeds and pesticides.	I	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
The biggest concern for shareholders may simply be that the deal looks like it will destroy value.	I	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Bayer expects $1.5 billion of annual synergies.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
According to a Breakingviews estimate, this represents a net present value of around $11 billion compared with that $15 billion premium.	O	O
And Bayer has not said how much is supposed to come from enhanced revenue, which is typically hard to achieve in real life.	O	O
As a stand-alone company, Bayer’s crop science unit would be prey rather than predator.	B	Bayer
Monsanto’s Ebitda is roughly 40 percent bigger than the division that is acquiring it — and it even expressed an interest in buying Bayer’s agrochemical business earlier this year.	B	Bayer
The German giant has taken steps to reduce its sprawl, spinning out specialty chemicals and plastics, and the remainder of its business is well run.	B	Monsanto
From the perspective of Bayer’s shareholders, selling the crops business for a premium might have been a much quicker and less risky way of creating value.	O	O

Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford and team call a Monsanto (MON) acquisition a "''once in a lifetime' opportunity" for Bayer (BAYRY), and expect the German chemical giant to up its bid for Monsanto.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Bayer management has laid out its base case for the acquisition of Monsanto (MON, $106.00, HOLD), valuing it at c.	O	O
$62.0bn (c.	O	O
€55.3bn), implying an acquisition multiple of c.15.9x EBITDA.	O	O
Management does not plan any major disposals to fund the acquisition and expects it to be funded through debt (c.	O	O
€41.5bn) and equity (c.	O	O
€13.8bn).	O	O
Management expects that after accruing revenue and operating cost synergies of c.	O	O
€1.5bn over three years post-close, the deal should be mid-single digit % accretive to CORE EPS in year 1 and then double digit % accretive thereafter.	O	O
We expect it to go all the way: Bayer has been aggressive in the past regarding acquisitions, taking Schering AG and Merck & Co.'s (MRK) Consumer Health business as examples.	B	Bayer
Monsanto looks to be a 'once in a lifetime' opportunity to finally build a fully integrated Agrochemicals business and management appear to accept the scarcity value associated with this.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Management's language during their investor calls has fully committed them on this transaction, in our view, and we expect them to take this to completion even if a bigger premium needs to be paid.	O	O
We see room for an increase to the offer for Monsanto when looking purely at EPS accretion.	O	O
Clearly this is not the only metric, but an important one for many investors, in our view.	O	O
Assuming that any increases to the current bid of $122 per share would be funded in the same proportion of 75% debt: 25% equity, we see little impact to the accretion offered by this transaction at higher levels.	O	O
For example, raising the offer to $130 per share still implies c.6% accretion in 2018E (the first full year in our accretion model, which runs from mid-2017) and c.12% accretion by 2020E.	O	O
Raising the offer to $140 in our model implies c.4% accretion in 2018E and c.10% accretion by 2020E.	O	O
We do not expect that Bayer would go beyond $140 per share as an offer, given the prospect for double-digit accretion may be difficult to achieve after that point.	O	O
Shares of Monsanto have gained 1.7% to $107.75 at 11:32 a.m., while Bayer has advanced 1.9% to $97.25, and Merck has risen 1.5% to $55.72.	O	O

Squaring a Bid for Monsanto With Bayer\u2019s Reward
Monsanto, a producer of genetically modified seeds, is known for items like its Asgrow soybeans.	O	O
CreditDaniel Acker/BloombergThe German chemical group Bayer’s bid for Monsanto may yield a poor financial harvest.	B	Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Bayer’s rejected $62 billion offer for Monsanto, an American seed maker, already appears to violate one of its crucial management principles: sticking to projects whose returns beat their cost of capital.	B	Monsanto rejects Bayer's $62bn takeover offer
Raising the price from the current $122 a share to win over its intended partner would require heroic sales-growth assumptions to stack up.	O	O
Monsanto’s revenue could reach $13.7 billion for its fiscal year that will end in August, according to the average estimate of analysts on Wall Street.	B	Monsanto
Assuming that Bayer can increase its revenue by a chunky 10 percent a year, it would hit $20 billion by 2020, allowing for a year or so to secure the necessary deal approvals.	B	Bayer
That is also the year when expected annual cost savings of $1.5 billion would fully kick in.	I	Bayer
Apply Monsanto’s average margins over the last five years, lump in the expected synergies, and tax everything at 25 percent, and Bayer’s investment would throw off about $4.7 billion of operating profit before interest costs.	O	O
It would amount to a 7.5 percent return on the $62 billion of debt and equity tied up in the investment — assuming Monsanto can increase sales aggressively.	O	O
That’s not far off the 7.6 percent cost of capital that Bayer estimated for its business last year.	O	O
The more relevant figure, though, is the cost of capital of the acquired business, which Morningstar estimates at 8.3 percent.	O	O
On that benchmark, Bayer falls short.	O	O
Raising the offer to $135 a share – a price some analysts think could persuade Monsanto to sell – would be even harder to justify.	B	takeover offer
Using the same math, it would take more than $25 billion of annual sales for Bayer to clear the value hurdle.	B	Bayer
That would require nearly doubling Monsanto’s sales in less than five years.	B	Monsanto
There could, perhaps, be more costs to squeeze out – it’s common for acquirers to lowball them.	O	O
Werner Baumann, the chief executive of Bayer, may also reason that combining Monsanto’s high-tech seeds with Bayer’s crop sprays could bring in handsome extra rewards.	O	O
It would be tough, though, to reap enough from the investment to keep shareholders happy.	O	O

“To say that Israel has no connection to the Temple Mount and Western Wall is like saying China has no connection to the Great Wall of China or Egypt has no connection to the pyramids,” the PM added.	O	O
The US, Israel’s chief ally, has also registered its opposition to the resolution, claiming it will damage the peace process.	O	O
State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said it would “do nothing to advance constructive results on the ground” and should not be adopted.	O	O

Israel has suspended ties with UNESCO, the UN body in charge of preserving culture and history, after a draft decision that Israel says ignores Judaism's ties to the religion's holiest site.	O	O
- Christianity, Judaism and Islam -- but makes no mention of why the city is significant to Christians or Jews.	O	O
A subsidiary body of UNESCO's Executive Board passed the resolution Thursday in Paris.	O	O
It refers to Jerusalem's holiest site -- known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary -- only by its Muslim name.	O	O
The draft decision, which largely criticizes Israel's actions in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, was proposed by a group of Arab countries and drew harsh rebukes from Israel and the United States.	B	Israel
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the move as absurd, saying: "To say that Israel has no connection to the Temple Mount and the Western Wall is like saying that China has no connection to the Great Wall of China or that Egypt has no connection to the Pyramids.	O	O
By this absurd decision, UNESCO has lost what little legitimacy it has left.	B	UNESCO
"In a letter from Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett following the vote, Israel announced it will freeze all professional activities with UNESCO.	O	O
US State Department spokesman Mark Toner also criticized the decision.	O	O
"We are deeply concerned about these kinds of recurring, politicized resolutions that do nothing to advance constructive results on the ground.	O	O
And we don't believe they should be adopted," Toner said.	O	O
The United States stopped funding UNESCO in 2011 over the organization's acceptance of a Palestinian bid for full membership.	O	O
Washington had contributed $80 million a year to the organization before then.	O	O
This week's resolution, put forward by Arab countries including Egypt, Algeria and Qatar, was adopted by a 24-6 vote, with 26 abstentions.	O	O
"Palestine will continue to defend the rights of our people through all available legal and diplomatic avenues, including UN organizations," a ministry statement said.	O	O
"Our peaceful agenda will not be derailed by propaganda, nor will our tolerance and adherence to international law by altered by fallacies and cynical spin.	O	O
"To Jews and Christians, the Temple Mount is the site of the foundation stone on which Adam was created and the site where Abraham came to sacrifice his son Isaac.	O	O
To Jews, it is also the site of the First and Second Temples.	O	O
To Muslims, it is the site where the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven on his miraculous "night journey.	O	O
"Responding to Israel's criticism in a statement, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova suggested she wasn't pleased with the decision.	B	Israel
"The outstanding universal value of the City, and the reason why it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, lies in this synthesis, which is an appeal for dialogue, not confrontation," Bokova said.	O	O
"When these divisions carry over into UNESCO, an organization dedicated to dialogue and peace, they prevent us from carrying out our mission.	O	O
"Bennett, the Israeli education minister, welcomed Bokova's statement but said it wasn't enough, calling on UNESCO to cancel the decision.	O	O
"Words are important, but they are not a replacement to the actions of the organization she heads.	O	O
"The draft decision will go before a full plenary of the UNESCO Executive Board on Tuesday.	O	O
It will either be adopted unanimously, or be the subject of further debate and a possible vote.	O	O

The hilltop site is sacred to both Jews and Muslims
The hilltop site is sacred to both Jews and MuslimsIsrael has frozen co-operation with the UN's cultural agency, accusing it of denying Judaism's connections to the religion's holiest sites.	B	UNESCO
Its education minister said a Unesco draft decision concerning Jerusalem "denies history and encourages terror".	B	UNESCO
It comes after the body approved a text which repeatedly used only the Islamic name for a hilltop complex which is also the holiest site in Judaism.	O	O
The site is known to Jews as the Temple Mount and Haram al-Sharif to Muslims.	O	O
The draft decision, submitted by several Arab countries, criticises Israel's activities at holy places in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank.	O	O
While acknowledging the "importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions", the document refers to the sacred hilltop only by the name "al-Aqsa Mosque/al-Haram al-Sharif" (Noble Sanctuary).	O	O
It is the location of two Biblical Jewish temples and is flanked by the Western Wall, venerated by Jews as part of the original supporting wall of the temple compound.	O	O
Haram al-Sharif is also the place where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, and is the third holiest site in Islam.	O	O
The draft refers to the precinct in front of the wall as "al-Buraq Plaza 'Western Wall Plaza'" - placing single quote marks only around "Western Wall", giving the name as it is known to Jews less weight than the one by which it is known to Muslims.	O	O
The stated aim of the text was "the safeguarding of the cultural heritage of Palestine and the distinctive character of East Jerusalem".	O	O
It repeatedly denounced Israeli actions, including the use of force, imposition of restrictions on Muslim worshippers and archaeological work.	B	Israel
Israel regards such criticism as politically motivated.	O	O
The draft text was passed at committee stage by 24 votes in favour, six against, and 26 abstentions.	O	O
Two countries were absent.	O	O
It will now be submitted to Unesco's executive body, which will vote on whether to adopt it.'Delusional decision'Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett said Unesco was ignoring "thousands of years of Jewish ties to Jerusalem" and aiding "Islamist terror".	B	UNESCO
Unesco chief Irina Bokova criticised the draft resolution, saying "different peoples worship the same places, sometimes under different names.	O	O
The recognition, use of and respect for these names is paramount.	O	O
"However, Mr Bennett said Ms Bokova's statement was insufficient.	O	O
"Words are important, but they are not a replacement to the actions of the organisation she heads," he said.	O	O
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a Facebook post that Unesco had become a "theatre of the absurd" in taking "another delusional decision".	B	UNESCO
"To say that Israel has no connection to the Temple Mount and the Western Wall is like saying that China has no connection to the Great Wall of China or that Egypt has no connection to the pyramids.	O	O
By this absurd decision, Unesco has lost what little legitimacy it had left.	O	O
"  The text will be submitted to Unesco's executive bodyThe move was also condemned by Jewish organisations around the world, including the World Jewish Congress, which called it an "inflammatory, one-sided decision".	O	O
However Palestinians, who seek an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza, welcomed the measure.	O	O
"This is an important message to Israel that it must end its occupation and recognise the Palestinian state and Jerusalem as its capital with its sacred Muslim and Christian sites," said Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.	O	O

(The Associated Press)TOKYO – Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe won parliamentary approval Friday for ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, despite U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to withdraw from the 12-nation trade pact.	O	O
Upper house lawmakers approved the TPP on Friday, heeding Abe's calls to push ahead with it despite Trump's rejection of the free-trade initiative championed by President Barack Obama.	O	O
Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has an ample majority in both houses of parliament.	O	O
Ratification of needed regulatory revisions by the Cabinet is expected soon.	O	O
The market opening measures required by the trade pact are seen as a way for Abe to push through difficult reforms of the agricultural and health sectors.	O	O
So far, Abe has made scant progress on a slew of changes he has proposed to help improve Japan's lagging productivity and competitiveness.	O	O
Trump has vowed to take steps to exit the pact right after he takes office.	O	O
A U.S. withdrawal would kill the trade pact unless its terms are revised.	B	TPP trade pact
The agreement between the dozen members requires both the U.S. and Japan to join to attain the required 85 percent of the group's total GDP since the U.S. economy accounts for 60 percent of that total, and Japan less than 20 percent.	O	O
After expending political capital to fight vested interests fearful of market opening and reforms likely to be required by the trade pact, Abe and other leaders in Asia have bemoaned the impending loss of the U.S. as TPP flag bearer.	O	O
"We want to carry this out and expect others will follow suit," Abe recently told a parliamentary committee.	B	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
An opposition lawmaker, Eri Tokunaga, derided Abe's insistence on going ahead with ratification as "egocentric.	B	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
""There is basically zero chance of this coming into effect since the next president, Trump, plans to leave it," Tokunaga told fellow lawmakers Friday.	B	TPP trade pact
Leaders in New Zealand and several other countries have said they still hope to find a way to rescue the initiative.	B	TPP trade pact
The TPP was meant to help give the U.S. a leading role in setting trade rules reaching beyond tariffs and other conventional trade barriers.	O	O
It's possible demise could spur faster progress on another, much less discussed trade agreement called the RCEP, or Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.	B	TPP trade pact
That trade grouping includes no countries from the Americas but all the big hitters in Asia: China, India, Japan, South Korea as well as Australia, New Zealand and the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.	O	O

Diet ratifies TPP but trade deal remains dead in the water without U.S.
Pacific Partnership pact on Friday as the ruling camp approved the trade deal and its related legislation in the Upper House, overcoming resistance from the opposition camp.	O	O
However, the chance of the free trade deal taking effect is considered very slim because U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to withdraw from the agreement as soon as he is sworn in on Jan. 20.	B	TPP trade pact
Even Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has admitted that a TPP without the U.S. would be “meaningless.	B	TPP trade pact
”The United States economy accounts for as much as 60 percent of the combined gross domestic product of the TPP’s 12 members, including Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.	O	O
Still, Abe’s ruling coalition rushed to ratify the pact, arguing that Japan should take the initiative to stamp out protectionism and act as a standard bearer for new free trade laws around the world.	B	TPP trade pact
“It’s very important for us, as a country, to show ideal rules that we believe the world should aim for,” Abe told an Upper House session earlier in the day.	B	Japan
Abe also said that the TPP would set new standards for environmental issues and competitive rules for state-owned enterprises.	O	O
For Japan to uphold such a trade pact would have a positive impact on negotiations related to other global free trade agreements, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, Abe said.	B	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
“It will also positively impact the U.S., which is now in a transition period” ahead of Trump’s inauguration, Abe added.	I	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
The TPP does not include China, which is among the countries in the RCEP talks.	O	O
Experts have said the TPP would carry strategic importance for Japan in setting new trade rules favorable to it and other countries calling for a global standard for conducting freer trade.	B	TPP trade pact
But the TPP will not take effect unless it earns the support of at least six countries that account for 85 percent or more of the combined GDP of the 12 member states.	O	O
This means the TPP would be nullified if the U.S. withdraws.	B	TPP trade pact
Trump has repeatedly bashed the TPP as an unfair agreement that would threaten American jobs, a message that resonates with economically frustrated voters.	B	TPP trade pact
At a full session of the Upper House, the Democratic Party and the Japanese Communist Party voted against the TPP.	B	TPP trade pact
Most of the support came from the ruling coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito, and from Nippon Ishin no Kai, a small opposition party that often sides with the ruling camp.	O	O
According to the government, the TPP would boost GDP by ¥13.6 trillion and create 795,000 new domestic jobs.	B	TPP trade pact
Meanwhile, domestic agricultural production would be reduced by up to ¥210 billion a year, according to the government.	I	TPP trade pact
Agricultural lobbies, once one of the LDP’s most powerful supporters, have strongly opposed the deal.	B	TPP trade pact

| POOL / VIA KYODOPrime Minister Shinzo Abe and Singaporean President Tony Tan affirmed in Tokyo on Thursday the importance of ratifying and bringing into force the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal to prevent a regression in the progress of free trade.	B	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
Japan, Singapore and 10 other Pacific Rim nations signed the TPP in February.	O	O
It effectively requires U.S. ratification to come into force, meaning U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to withdraw from the pact as soon as he takes office in January has put its future in doubt.	B	TPP trade pact
“We discussed the economic and strategic importance of the TPP and agreed that it is in the interests of all TPP partners to ensure that the TPP is ratified and enters into force expeditiously,” Tan told a joint press conference after the meeting.	O	O
Abe and Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had agreed at a summit in Tokyo in September to cooperate in swiftly bringing the pact into force.	O	O
Abe and Tan also agreed Thursday to work together toward the swift conclusion of negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, another multilateral trade deal for the Asia-Pacific region.	O	O
The RCEP negotiations currently exclude the United States, making China the biggest participant by gross domestic product.	O	O
Abe and several other leaders of the TPP signatories have alluded to the strategic importance of the TPP, which excludes China.	O	O
The leaders also discussed the suitability of Japan’s shinkansen bullet train technology for a proposed high-speed railway line linking Singapore and the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.	O	O
Abe said Japan and Singapore will hold a “comprehensive, high-level consultation” before the end of the year “to strengthen our cooperation in transportation infrastructure across the three fields of land, sea and air, including in high-speed rail projects.	O	O
”“I strongly hope there will be progress on the adoption of Japan’s shinkansen technology,” Abe said.	O	O
“On the shinkansen, Singapore recognizes the long record of safety, reliability and efficiency of Japanese technology,” Tan replied at the press conference.	O	O
The Singaporean leader said Japan is welcome to put in a competitive bid for the project.	B	Japan
“Singapore and Malaysia will work together to ensure a rigorous, objective and transparent tender process to achieve our common interest in having the best technology for the project,” Tan said.	O	O
The leaders also said they exchanged opinions on issues of peace and security, but refrained from making any specific reference to territorial issues in the South China Sea.	O	O
“Singapore welcomes Japan to continue playing a positive role in the region under the framework of the U.S.-Japan security alliance,” Tan said.	B	Japan
Tan is on a nine-day state visit to Japan through next Tuesday.	O	O

Pacific Partnership trade pact last week may seem like a waste of time.	B	TPP trade pact
Donald Trump says he will pull out of the deal on his first day in office.	O	O
And according to TPP’s text, the treaty doesn’t go into effect until signatories accounting for 85% of the combined GDP of the group ratify it.	O	O
Since the U.S.GDP is 60% of the total, its absence kills the deal.	B	TPP trade pact
Yet the Diet’s move serves two useful purposes.	B	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
One is as a marker of Shinzo Abe’s determination to seek other trade deals and reform his domestic economy.	I	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
The other is the Prime Minister’s message to Mr. Trump that Asia and the world need American leadership on trade.	I	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
Mr. Abe’s program to revive Japan’s economy is dead in the water without the market-opening advances of TPP.	B	TPP trade pact
Abenomics has so far consisted of monetary and fiscal stimulus, which have mostly proved counterproductive.	O	O
The government promised to undertake other reforms, the “third arrow,” to force Japanese producers to become more competitive as well as benefit consumers, but it has so far failed to do so.	B	Japan
Mr. Abe and other TPP partners can use the failed agreement as a template for new deals that contain similar reductions in nontariff barriers, especially in service industries, and improve protection for intellectual property.	O	O
Even if these are only bilateral agreements, they will maintain the momentum for an eventual multilateral deal similar to TPP.	O	O
TPP might even be salvaged in some form.	B	TPP trade pact
Tensions with China could force Mr. Trump to re-evaluate his opposition before the October 2017 ratification deadline.	O	O
The TPP’s value as a strategic tool to bolster the unity and prosperity of American allies could overcome overblown fears of lost jobs.	B	TPP trade pact
It’s also not impossible for the other 11 signatories of the TPP to revise the treaty to leave out the U.S.	O	O
That would take some fancy diplomatic footwork to avoid reopening the terms of the treaty.	O	O
But if it worked, it would preserve the progress to date and leave the door open to the U.S. to join later.	O	O
Japan was once a reluctant free-trader.	B	Japan
It has stepped up under Mr. Abe, but it can’t replace the U.S. as the keystone of the liberal international order.	I	Japan
Tokyo can oppose the tendency to slide into protectionism in the hope that the responsibility of governing will move the Trump Administration back to the postwar consensus in favor of an open trading system.	I	Japan

Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation free trade agreement is unlikely to come into force as it currently stands given U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to pull the United States out of it once he takes office in January.	B	TPP trade pact
Some scholars have suggested that if the Trump administration does quit the TPP, the 11 other member states should renegotiate the deal so it can go into effect without U.S. participation, rather than giving it up altogether.	O	O
The TPP, in its current form, can only take effect if it is ratified by at least six members that represent 85 percent of the combined gross domestic product of the 12 members.	O	O
Without U.S. ratification, the free trade agreement would effectively be dead because the United States alone accounts for 60 percent of the group’s total GDP.	B	TPP trade pact
The scholars urged Japan, the second-largest economy in the TPP, which does not involve China, to take the lead in renegotiations so as to keep the deal’s spirit to establish high-standard trade rules for the Asia-Pacific region alive and to leave the door open for future U.S. reentry into the group.	B	Japan
Referring to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s pronouncement that the TPP “would be meaningless without the United States,” Stephan Haggard, a professor of political science at the University of California San Diego, said, “That’s not necessarily a right move.	B	TPP trade pact
”“If Japan were to step in and exercise leadership with respect to TPP and say, ‘Well, this is an agreement which these parties have negotiated, the Diet has ratified it and we see ourselves bound by these negotiations, and we are going to move forward, and we hope that the United States comes back,’ that might be an interesting move,” Haggard said.	B	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
“I don’t know if Abe is willing to do that.	B	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
But I think it’s one of the options that has to be considered.	I	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
”Shihoko Goto, a senior associate for Northeast Asia at the Woodrow Wilson Center, a Washington think tank, also called for Abe’s leadership in implementing what would be an 11-member TPP in the event of a U.S. exit.	O	O
Citing the possibility that Abe, who returned to power in December 2012, could serve until 2021, Goto said that with this stability Abe could “focus on broad legacy-building issues, which could certainly include redefining Japan’s role in the world.	O	O
”“With the United States and Europe — with the exception of Germany under Chancellor Angela Merkel — becoming increasingly inwardly focused, expectations for Japan to take on a greater role in promoting the development of international rules and global institutions … could actually rise,” Goto said.	O	O
“Promoting TPP with 11 member countries instead of 12 could actually be the first step.	B	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
”Taking into account Trump’s insistence even after the Nov. 8 presidential election that he would replace the TPP with bilaterally negotiated trade deals that would “bring jobs and industry back onto American shores,” the survival — and the ultimate success — of the pact would effectively rest on Abe’s leadership.	O	O
While Trump’s announcement has prompted Vietnam to shelve its ratification of the TPP, Malaysia has said that if the TPP is a nonstarter, negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a proposed 16-nation, less-ambitious free trade agreement that does not include the United States, should be concluded as early as possible.	B	TPP trade pact
Seven of the 12 TPP members — Australia, Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam — are negotiating members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership as well.	O	O
Referring to growing uncertainties about the TPP, Goto said, “This would be an opportunity for Abe to promote Japan as the leader in Asia and beyond to ensure stability and adherence to a new liberal economic order.	B	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
”Others argue that regardless of whether Trump will actually withdraw the United States from the TPP, it will be important for Tokyo and Washington to continue to push for high-standard trade rules in areas such as intellectual property rights, treatment of state-owned enterprises, labor provisions and environmental protection that are covered by the TPP but not in many other agreements.

Japan\u2019s ratification of the TPP
Pacific Partnership pact, touted as a free trade deal encompassing economies that together account for 40 percent of the world’s gross domestic product, will end up as an exercise in futility unless the agreement takes effect — which now seems doomed with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s repeated vow to pull his country out of the deal.	B	TPP trade pact
If the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe genuinely believes in the TPP’s benefits to spur the Japanese economy, he needs to explore a Plan B to pursue what the pact is supposed to achieve.	O	O
In fact, the government’s estimate that the TPP would push Japan’s GDP upward by more than 2 percent in real terms in 10 to 20 years is reputed to be based on rosy scenarios that everything will go just as hoped.	O	O
Its forecast that the deal would add ¥13.6 trillion to the economy and generate nearly 800,000 new jobs is widely seen as overblown, while the expected damage to domestic agriculture output due to increased cheap farm imports — in the range of ¥130 billion to ¥210 billion — is viewed as underestimated.	B	TPP trade pact
But even assuming that the government’s estimates of the TPP’s benefits are reasonable, they will come to nothing if the pact does not enter into force.	B	TPP trade pact
The agreement among 12 Pacific Rim countries is to take effect when it’s been ratified by at least six members that together account for 85 percent or more of the GDP of the signatories combined.	O	O
In other words, the deal needs to be ratified by both the U.S. and Japan — by far the two largest economies involved.	O	O
Abe, who acknowledged that a TPP without participation of the U.S. would be “meaningless,” is said to have pushed for the Diet’s approval in the hope that ratification by Japan would prompt Trump to somehow change his mind.	B	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
The prime minister also told the Diet it was important for Japan to “send a message about the TPP’s strategic and economic significance of creating a fair economic grouping” even when the prospect of its implementation is uncertain.	B	Japan
That will have only a symbolic importance if the deal is indeed doomed.	B	Japan ratifies TPP trade pact
Trump, who during the campaign blamed past free trade deals for pushing American jobs and industries out of the country, has repeatedly said he will withdraw the U.S. from the TPP on the day he takes office in January.	O	O
If the Abe administration indeed believes in the TPP as a key to drive up Japan’s growth, it should not be content with the Diet’s ratification and the slim hope that Trump might change his mind.	O	O
It should instead prepare to restructure its strategy on how to push the nation’s free trade agenda in case the deal is formally declared dead.	O	O
The TPP aims to promote trade and investments among its participants not only by lifting and cutting tariffs but setting common rules on intellectual property, government procurement and other areas of business.	O	O
While the government tends to play up the benefits of free trade pacts, there will be both positive and negative impacts of these agreements.	O	O
An estimate by the U.S.	O	O
International Trade Commission in May showed that the TPP would push up America’s GDP by a mere 0.15 percent in the 15th year of its implementation and that both output and jobs will slightly decline in manufacturing and energy sectors — given that the economic benefits of the deal will be limited since the U.S. already has free trade agreements with six of the TPP signatories.	O	O
That must be hardly reassuring for Trump, who won the election on his vow to pursue “America first” policies to bring back manufacturing jobs to the country.	O	O
Will there be practical alternatives to the TPP.	O	O
Trump said he would instead pursue bilateral trade agreements with other countries to bring back jobs and industries to the U.S.	O	O
There may emerge moves to rescue the TPP by changing its rules so that it can enter into force without the participation of the U.S.	O	O
The TPP, which does not include China as a member, has had the political aspect of the departing administration of President Barack Obama, in taking the initiative for the deal, seeking to secure the U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region in the face of China’s growing clout in this part of the world.	O	O
There are views that a U.S. pullout from the TPP will pave the way for China to take the lead in crafting the region’s trade architecture.	O	O
The Abe administration needs to prepare Japan’s possible responses to these questions.	O	O
There’s one thing that Abe seems certain of doing.	O	O
He said that with or without the TPP taking effect, his administration will go ahead with the government’s spending on domestic measures to deal with the free trade pact.	O	O
More than half of the roughly ¥1.2 trillion earmarked in the budget so far is going to the agricultural sector — to finance measures billed to boost the competitiveness of Japanese farmers against anticipated rise in imports, including public works projects to promote large-scale farming.	O	O
The prime minister said these measures are necessary to make Japan’s farming industry more competitive even if the TPP does not come into force.	O	O
But if so, his administration needs to make sure that the spending will accomplish what it is intended to achieve, instead of being wasted as were past government expenditures on the agriculture sector in the face of farm trade liberalization.	O	O

Mitsubishi Motors admits manipulating fuel economy tests
Mitsubishi Motors has admitted manipulating test data to overstate the fuel efficiency of 625,000 cars.	O	O
The Japanese carmaker said the inaccurate tests covered four of its mini-cars, two of which it manufactured for Nissan.	O	O
The number of Nissan cars affected was 468,000, while 157,000 were sold under the Mitsubishi brand.	O	O
When Nissan tested the cars supplied by Mitsubishi Motors, it found differences between its figures and Mitsubishi’s results.	O	O
Nissan asked Mitsubishi Motors to investigate and this led the company to discover “improper conduct” and tests that did not meet Japanese law.	O	O
The company released the information in a statement as its president, Tetsuro Aikawa, held a news conference.	O	O
He and other company officials bowed deeply at the start of the briefing.	O	O
Mitsubishi Motors said: “We found that with respect to the fuel consumption testing data … MMC conducted testing improperly to present better fuel consumption rates than the actual rates and that the testing method was also different from the one required by Japanese law.

Shares in the company tumbled 15% Wednesday after news emerged that it had illegally rigged fuel economy tests affecting hundreds of thousands of vehicles.	O	O
The company said the cheating it had discovered made the cars' fuel consumption rates appear better than they really were.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
The rigged tests affected four minicar models sold only in Japan, Mitsubishi said.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
It supplies two of the models to its bigger counterpart Nissan (NSANF).	O	O
Mitsubishi is halting production and sales of the cars.	O	O
It said it had sold 157,000 units of two of the models, and supplied 468,000 units of the other two models to Nissan.	O	O
"Taking into account the seriousness of these issues, we will also conduct an investigation into products manufactured for overseas markets," it said.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
The company said the problems came to light after Nissan spotted inconsistencies in the some of cars' fuel consumption data while working on the development of a new generation of minicars.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
Mitsubishi said it would "sincerely respond" to customers who bought the cars and would also discuss compensation with Nissan.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
The affected models are sold under the names eK Wagon, eK Space, Dayz and Dayz Roox.	O	O
Nissan gave a similar version of events in a statement, saying it was "working on solutions to support impacted owners.	O	O
"The Mitsubishi announcement follows a huge scandal that rocked German auto giant Volkswagen (VLKAF) last year after it admitted rigging diesel engine emissions tests in America and Europe.	O	O
Volkswagen fitted millions of vehicles with software that could cheat nitrogen oxide emissions tests.	O	O
The scandal resulted in massive recalls, lawsuits and the resignations of top executives, including CEO Martin Winterkorn.	O	O
But Mitsubishi's problems appear to have more in common with those faced in recent years by Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia.	O	O
The two companies agreed to pay a combined $100 million fine in the U.S. in 2014 for overstating fuel economy estimates for many of their vehicles.	O	O
They also had to refund customers for the difference in estimated fuel costs.	O	O
That same year, Ford said it would compensate owners of about 200,000 U.S. vehicles after discovering the cars' gas mileage was overstated.	O	O
In the last nine months of 2015, it sold 787,000 vehicles worldwide, generating revenue of around 1.7 trillion yen ($15 billion).-- Yoko Wakatsuki and Junko Ogura contributed to this report.	O	O

It's all in the pressure
It's all in the pressureMitsubishi Motors has admitted rigging data on some of its models' fuel efficiency.	O	O
About 625,000 cars sold in Japan were affected, and the production of the relevant models has been halted. the ek Wagon and eK Space - as well as 468,000 vehicles produced for Nissan - the Dayz and Dayz Roox.	O	O
What has Mitsubishi done.	O	O
Car companies try to outdo each other on how fuel-efficient their models are.	O	O
It impresses consumers because it's good for the environment, and it's easy on the wallet at the petrol station.	O	O
Fuel efficiency is tested by putting cars on what is essentially a treadmill where they run at a certain speed and fuel consumption is measured.	O	O
Mitsubishi appears to have overinflated the tyres, which gave better results on the fuel efficiency test.	O	O
Imagine inflating your bicycle tyres to the maximum and going up a hill, then letting half the air out and going up the same hill again.	O	O
It's much harder.	O	O
The extra muscle you need gives you an idea of the extra fuel that a car would burn through.	O	O
That climb is even harder with half the pressureThe controversy comes hard on the heels of the Volkswagen emissions scandal but is slightly different.	O	O
Volkswagen installed hidden software in its diesel models that detected when an official emissions test was being conducted.	O	O
The software would then lower the emission so the test readings were more favourable.	O	O
So VW rigged the level of harmful gases coming from the exhaust pipe to make their cars look greener than they were.	O	O
Mitsubishi rigged the fuel consumption readings so their cars would appear to use less fuel than they actually did.	O	O
Mitsubishi: Cars, aircon, fridges and nuclear.	O	O
Mitsubishi is a somewhat confusing brand.	O	O
There are a whole host of independent companies that share the name and trace their origins back to the original Mitsubishi company founded in 1870 in the shipping industry.	O	O
The current companies though are entirely independent from each other.	O	O
That means you will find the name in aviation, banking, air conditioners, the nuclear and chemical industry, optics and of course, cars.	O	O
The eK Wagon is one of the models affectedMitsubishi Motors is the sixth biggest car maker in Japan and number 16 worldwide.	O	O
Large-scale production got under way in the 1960s.	O	O
In 1977 the company entered the European market and in 1982 the US market.	O	O
Annual car production currently stands at 1,218,853 vehicles.	O	O
The current scandal is at Mitsubishi Motors.	O	O
Any damage to the brand name though, might spill over to the other companies.	O	O
Has Mitsubishi been involved in any other scandals in the past.	O	O
It's not the first time that Mitsubishi Motors has been in the headlines for misconduct.	O	O
In the early 2000s, the company had to admit to lying about defects in its cars for decades.	O	O
Back then, an internal investigation found that the firm had covered up faults since 1977 and repaired cars secretly, instead of reporting the problems to the transport ministry.	O	O
The cover-up led to huge recalls, criminal charges against several employees and a cost of billions to the company.	O	O

If Mitsubishi Motors needs help, group firms may look away
A decade ago, Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) survived a defect cover-up scandal through a bail-out by other Mitsubishi Group companies.	O	O
Now, facing uncertainty and potential liabilities from a new scandal, it may be on its own.	O	O
A man walks out from Mitsubishi Motors Corp's showroom at its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, April 21, 2016.	O	O
REUTERS/Toru HanaiMultiple senior officials at Mitsubishi companies said it would be “difficult” for them to help the car maker as they face their own financial squeeze, as well as calls to put shareholder returns above ties with the former Mitsubishi business empire, or “zaibatsu”, which was split up into independent companies after the Second World War.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors
A task force at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, the banking arm of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T) - which persuaded other group firms to rescue Mitsubishi Motors in 2004 - has reconvened in recent days to weigh the possible fallout of the automaker’s fuel economy cheating scandal, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.	O	O
The person said other Mitsubishi Group firms seemed reluctant to help, but stressed that Mitsubishi Motors has made no approach for assistance as it doesn’t yet know the extent of potential compensation costs and losses in sales and production.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
“At the moment, our priority is to cooperate with and disclose the results of ongoing investigations, and we’re not in a position to comment on assistance,” a spokeswoman for Mitsubishi Motors told Reuters.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) and Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T), which hold stakes in the car maker and have sales partnerships with it, would want to avoid its collapse, but have shown little interest in helping, the person said.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
“If other automakers could absorb it or merge with it, that would be better,” said the person, who didn’t want to be named as he is not authorized to speak with the media.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corp also hold smaller shares in Japan’s sixth-largest automaker.	O	O
“The investigation into Mitsubishi Motors over its falsified fuel economy data is ongoing, so at this point we cannot decide on whether to offer assistance,” said Shunichi Miyanaga, president and CEO of Mitsubishi Heavy, a builder of military aircraft, rail infrastructure and luxury cruise ships.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
It is the biggest shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors with a 12.6 percent stake, and Miyanaga sits on the automaker’s board.	O	O
CASH RESERVES Mitsubishi Motors may face a bill of as much as 104 billion yen ($935.2 million), according to Nomura analyst Masataka Kunugimoto, to compensate drivers, pay back government tax rebates and other payments - assuming a cost of 68,000-166,000 yen ($611-$1,493) per car, times the 625,000 cars affected.	O	O
Goldman Sachs estimates a potential cost of up to 200,000 yen per car.	O	O
Those numbers could escalate if the scandal widens to cars sold overseas - Mitsubishi sells only around a tenth of its cars in Japan - and if sales are hit by the adverse branding from it manipulating fuel economy test data.	O	O
On the plus side, Mitsubishi Motors had more than 480 billion yen ($4.32 billion) in cash at end-2015, and much lower gearing than rivals Mazda Motor (7261.T) and Isuzu Motors (7202.T).	O	O
Mitsubishi Heavy cut its annual net profit forecast on Monday to 66 billion yen from an earlier 90 billion yen forecast, and around half of last year’s profit, as its cruise ship business grappled with rising costs and construction delays.	O	O
An executive familiar with the situation at Mitsubishi Heavy said newly adopted corporate governance guidelines meant it and other listed Mitsubishi Group companies were wary of doing anything that could cost their own shareholders.	O	O
“Even 10 years ago, the Mitsubishi Heavy shareholder meeting turned disorderly with shareholders opposed to the Mitsubishi Motors bailout.	O	O
Now, the thinking around governance has evolved even more,” the executive said.	O	O
“Talking about a bailout invites questions about judgment.	O	O
”Trading group Mitsubishi Corp warned last month of a first annual loss since it was established in 1954, due to writedowns from plunging commodities prices.	O	O
Yet it is keeping its annual dividend forecast amid pressure for higher shareholder returns.	O	O
Its president is halving his pay, and all other executives have had their bonuses scrapped.	O	O
Shares in Mitsubishi Motors have slumped 45 percent since news of its test cheating broke last Wednesday.	O	O

Mitsubishi Motors: False mileage tests done since 1991
John Seifert, chief executive officer at Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, discusses the Mitsubishi data scandal and how companies can rebuild their brand and reputation after a scandal.	O	O
Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese automaker that acknowledged last week that it had intentionally lied about fuel economy data for some of its models, said an internal investigation found such tampering dated back to 1991.	O	O
President Tetsuro Aikawa told reporters Tuesday the probe was ongoing, suggesting that more irregularities might be found.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
“We don’t know the whole picture and we are in the process of trying to determine that,” he said at a news conference at the transport ministry.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
“I feel a great responsibility.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
”Aikawa said so much was unknown that it’s uncertain what action the company will take.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
He said he didn’t know why employees resorted to such tactics to make mileage look better.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Motors had repeatedly promised to come clean after a massive scandal 15 years ago involving a systematic cover-up of auto defects.	O	O
The inaccurate mileage tests involved 157,000 of its eK wagon and eK Space light passenger cars, and 468,000 Dayz and Dayz Roox vehicles produced for Nissan Motor.	O	O
The models are all so-called “minicars” with tiny engines whose main attraction is generally great mileage.	O	O
They were produced from March 2013.	O	O
The problem surfaced after Nissan pointed out inconsistencies in data.	O	O
The automaker found the company’s mileage goal for the minicars that had been set in 2011 was suddenly raised in 2013.	O	O
Why that happened is unclear, according to officials.	O	O
Aikawa also said it was unclear how customers were going to be compensated because the extent of the cheating was still under investigation.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
Mileage fraud is a violation of Japan’s fuel efficiency law for autos because buyers are eligible for tax breaks if a vehicle model delivers good mileage.	O	O
Possible penalties are still unclear due to the uncertainties over the investigation’s outcome, according to the transport ministry.	O	O
Mitsubishi Motors released two diagrams explaining how road tests were manipulated.	O	O
The company, which also makes the Outlander sport-utility vehicle and the i-MiEV electric car, has arranged for a panel of three lawyers, including a former prosecutor, to further investigate the mileage scandal from an outsider’s point of view, with a report expected within three months.	O	O
Production and sales of all affected models have been halted.	O	O
Japan is periodically shaken by scandals at top-name companies, including electronics company Toshiba, which had doctored accounting books for years, and medical equipment company Olympus, which acknowledged it had covered up massive losses.	O	O
Mitsubishi Motors struggled for years to win back consumer trust after an auto defects scandal in the early 2000s over cover-ups of problems such as failing brakes, faulty clutches and fuel tanks prone to falling off dating back to the 1970s.	O	O
That resulted in more than a million vehicles being recalled retroactively.	O	O
The Mitsubishi brand was tarnished seriously when a wheel rolled off a Mitsubishi truck in 2002, killing a woman who was walking down a sidewalk.	O	O
That truck had not been recalled but parts had been changed on it under free inspections.	O	O

Shares in Mitsubishi Motors were down up to 16 per cent on Wednesday morning in anticipation of the announcement.	O	O
Mitsubishi is Japan's largest car maker.	O	O
It sold more than one million vehicles last year but has less than 1 per cent of the UK market.	O	O
This is the first time a Japanese car maker has been implicated in a vehicle testing scandal since the emissions scandal engulfed Volkswagen last year.	O	O
Mitsubishi's admission of falsifying data is different to Volkswagen's because it relates to petrol-powered cars, while VW cheated in emissions tests on diesel models.	O	O
The VW scandal that broke on September 18 last year was initially confined to 500,000 cars but escalated to involve 11 million vehicles.	O	O
VW has reached an agreement with EU regulators on how to handle the fix for affected cars.	O	O
A deal with US regulators is yet to be agreed.	O	O
Volkswagen is in the process of recalling millions of cars and has set aside £4.8 billion to cover costs.	O	O

Mitsubishi Motors shares dive, Japan officials raid facility
Japanese officials raided a facility belonging to Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) on Thursday after the carmaker admitted to overstating the fuel efficiency of 625,000 cars, a revelation that has sent its shares into a tailspin.	O	O
A spokeswoman for the company said the raid by members of Japan’s Transport Ministry at a plant in the central Japanese city of Okazaki would continue on Friday.	O	O
Earlier on Thursday, Mitsubishi shares slid for a second straight day, hitting a record low amid concerns about the potential cost of compensation and fines from the biggest scandal to hit the company since a defect cover-up a decade ago.	O	O
The stock has lost a third of its market value, or $2.5 billion, in the last two days.	O	O
The problem, which the government has called “extremely serious”, came to light after Nissan Motor (7201.T), which markets a model made by Mitsubishi, found a discrepancy in fuel efficiency test data.	O	O
It affects two models - Mitsubishi’s eK mini-wagon and Nissan’s Dayz, with both automakers saying they will halt sales of the vehicles.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
JPMorgan auto analyst Akira Kishimoto estimated the cheating could cost Mitsubishi more than 50 billion yen ($450 million), including payments to consumers, the cost of replacing parts and compensation to Nissan.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
And while Mitsubishi said the cars were sold only in Japan, the impact could be felt further afield.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
“In addition to the costs of the scandal, the secondary effects on worldwide sales could be very large,” Kishimoto wrote in a client note, adding the automaker has tied its brand to environmentally friendly technology with its fuel-sipping, plug-in hybrids and fully electric vehicles.

The scandal came as German auto giant Volkswagen struggles to restore its badly dented reputation after revelations of emissions rigging.	O	O
On Wednesday, Mitsubishi admitted that unnamed employees rigged tests to make some of its cars seem more fuel-efficient than they were in reality.	O	O
The company said it would halt production and sales of the affected models -- mini-cars sold in Japan including some made for rival Nissan -- and warned that the number of cars involved in the scandal would likely rise, as it looks to vehicles sold overseas.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
Mini-cars, or kei-cars, are small vehicles with 660cc gasoline engines that are hugely popular in the Japanese market, although they have found little success abroad.	O	O
"Certainly it is a blow," Christopher Richter, a Tokyo-based auto analyst at brokerage CLSA, told AFP.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
"The vast majority of (Mitsubishi's) business in Japan has become selling mini-vehicles to Nissan because the market share of their own branded products after the scandal in the 2000s withered down to practically nothing.	O	O

Mitsubishi Motors admits manipulating fuel economy data, shares tumble
Mitsubishi Motors Corp admitted to manipulating test data to overstate the fuel economy of 625,000 cars sold in Japan, knocking its shares down more than 15 percent and wiping $1.2 billion off its market value on Wednesday.	O	O
The automaker said it stopped making and selling its eK mini-wagons for the domestic market after Nissan Motor, which markets a similar model made by Mitsubishi, found a discrepancy in fuel efficiency test data.	O	O
Mitsubishi Motors said the fuel economy levels of models made for the local market were up to a tenth lower than stated in its test results.	O	O
It said it manipulated those levels to gain a favourable reading for its fuel economy certification.	O	O
As global emissions regulations tighten, fuel economy has become a major factor for environmental- and cost-conscious buyers.	O	O
Tetsuro Aikawa, the president of Japan’s sixth-largest automaker, bowed in apology at a news conference in Tokyo for what is the biggest scandal at Mitsubishi Motors since a damaging defect cover-up over a decade ago.	O	O
“We’d like to apologise for the issue,” Aikawa said.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
“The focus right now is to resolve this problem and prevent it from happening again it could be quite damaging.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
”Shares in Mitsubishi Motors closed down more than 15 percent at 733 yen, the stock’s biggest one-day drop in almost 12 years.	O	O
Shares in Nissan closed down 1 percent.	O	O
Mitsubishi Motors said the test manipulation involved 625,000 vehicles produced since mid-2013.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
These include its eK mini-wagon as well as 468,000 cars it made for Nissan, which markets them as the Dayz.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
MINISTRY ORDERS REPORT Nissan, which has sold 450,000 of its Mitsubishi-made Dayz since 2013, said the manufacturer admitted intentionally falsifying the data.	O	O
It said it had no plans to change its relationship with Mitsubishi Motors for now, and would not comment on how the issue might impact the development of updated models.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
Mitsubishi said it would examine other models made for global markets to verify their fuel economy levels.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
The company said that in calculating its cars’ fuel efficiency, it measured how much they slowed per second rather than the time it takes to slow by 10 kms (6.2 miles) per hour, as required under Japanese regulations.	O	O
It also manipulated the equipment used to measure a car’s rolling resistance during fuel economy tests, and used a different testing system from other Japanese automakers.	O	O
Japan’s Transport Ministry ordered Mitsubishi Motors to submit a full report on the test manipulation within a week, and for other Japanese automakers to also submit fuel economy test data by May 18.	O	O
“We are disappointed this has occurred and regret that an incident like this can also happen in Japan,” said Takao Onoda, director at the ministry’s recall division.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
Mitsubishi Motors’ admission follows its revelation in 2000 that it covered up safety records and customer complaints.	O	O
Four years later it admitted to broader problems going back decades.	O	O
It was Japan’s worst automotive recall scandal at the time.	O	O
Mitsubishi Motors, which has annual sales of just over 1 million cars, is the first Japanese automaker to report misconduct involving fuel economy tests since Volkswagen was discovered last year to have cheated diesel emissions tests in the United States and elsewhere.	O	O
South Korean car makers Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors Corp in 2014 agreed to pay $350 million in penalties to the U.S. government for overstating their vehicles’ fuel economy ratings.	O	O

The Mitsubishi Mileage Scandal Is Even Worse Than People Thought
Mitsubishi Motors’s fuel economy scandal broadened on Friday as U.S. auto safety authorities said they were seeking information, and media reported that the automaker had submitted misleading data on at least one more model than disclosed and likely several others.	O	O
Japan’s sixth-largest automaker admitted this week it had overstated the fuel efficiency of 625,000 cars, wiping off around 40% of its market value, or $3.2 billion in three days.	O	O
The revelations have also prompted Japanese authorities to raid one of its research and development facilities while Standard & Poor’s warned its rating could be lowered further into speculative grade territory.	O	O
Adding to fears that the scandal will lead to ballooning compensation costs and fines, top Japanese government officials said Mitsubishi (mmtof, -1.17%) may have to reimburse consumers and the government if investigations find the vehicles were not as fuel-efficient as claimed.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
“This is a serious problem that could lead to the loss of trust in our country’s auto industry,” Transport Minister Keiichi Ishii told a news conference on Friday.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
He said he wanted Mitsubishi to look at the possibility of buying back the cars in question, while another minister was quoted by media as saying the government could ask it to pay for any electric car subsidies granted to consumers.	I	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
Domestic media reported that Mitsubishi had submitted misleading mileage data on its i-MiEV electric car, which is also sold overseas.	O	O
Previously disclosed models are marketed specifically for the Japanese market and Mitsubishi has admitted to manipulating their fuel economy readings.	O	O
The Sankei newspaper also said the automaker is also suspected of using non-Japanese test methodology on its RVR, Outlander, Pajero and Minicab MiEV models.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
Mitsubishi has said there may be models other than those disclosed that violate Japanese regulations.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
A spokesman said on Friday the company was still looking into those models.	O	O
“A lot of the potential impact on Mitsubishi is pending whether they find out that something was wrong in cars sold in the U.S.,” said Christopher Richter, an analyst at CLSA.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
A Plethora of ScandalsAn official at the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told Reuters the regulator had asked Mitsubishi for information on vehicles sold in the United States.	O	O
He declined to comment on which models it had requested information on, or whether it had requested data from other automakers.	O	O
The misconduct has revived memories of a scandal more than 15 years ago in which Mitsubishi admitted to systematically covering up customer complaints for more than 20 years, bringing the company close to collapse.	O	O
The industry is also facing an ongoing massive recall of air bag inflators made by Japan’s Takata Corp, which have been linked to 11 deaths and more than 100 injuries, mainly in the United States.	O	O
Emissions cheating scandals have also erupted.	O	O
Volkswagen AG (vlkpf, +2.31%) announced a sweeping U.S. deal on Thursday to buy back or potentially fix about a half million cars and set up environmental and consumer compensation funds after it used software to conceal the level of toxic emissions.	O	O
This week alone, PSA Peugeot Citroen (pugoy, +2.16%) was raided by France’s anti-fraud investigators as part of ongoing probes on pollutants in the industry.	O	O
Peugeot says its vehicles are compliant.	B	tests
Daimler AG (ddaif, +1.54%) also said it opened an internal emissions probe at the request of the U.S. Justice Department.	O	O
Japan’s Transport Ministry has ordered Mitsubishi to submit a full report on its test data within a week, and for other domestic automakers to submit fuel economy test data by May 18.	O	O
Mitsubishi, which sells over 1 million cars annually, has said it expects to post operating income of 125 billion yen ($1.1 billion) for the year just ended.	O	O

Mitsubishi said it issued exaggerated fuel economy figures for some models sold in Japan after Nissan, which was also selling the rebranded vehicles, discovered the inconsistencies with the fuel efficiency data
Mitsubishi is the latest carmaker to hold its hands up to manipulating fuel economy tests, revealing on Wednesday that it had 'conducted testing improperly to present better fuel consumption' than published figures suggested.	O	O

Mitsubishi said it issued exaggerated fuel economy figures for some models sold in Japan after Nissan, which was also selling the rebranded vehicles, discovered the inconsistencies with the fuel efficiency dataMitsubishi's president, Tetsuro Aikawa, confirmed the news during a press conference in Tokyo, revealing that the fuel consumption data submitted for more than 600,000 cars it produced were not tested to the required standard set by Japanese law.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
Of all the affected cars, just 157,000 were sold as Mitsubishis; the renaming 468,000 were rebranded as Nissans, who later retested the vehicles to reveal the manipulated fuel economy figures.	O	O
The official Mitsubishi statement said: 'In the process of the development for the next generation of mini-car products, NM [Nissan Motors] examined the fuel consumption rates of the applicable cars for NM's reference and found deviations in the figures.'NM requested MMC [Mitsubishi Motor Cars] to review the running resistance (the rolling resistance mainly generated by the tyres and air resistance while the vehicle is moving) value set by MMC during tests by MMC.'In the course of our internal investigation upon this request, MMC learned of the improper conduct that MMC used the running resistance value for testing which provided more advantageous fuel consumption rates than the actual rates.'MMC will sincerely respond to our customers who own and use the applicable cars.'Following the statement, Japanese officials raided one of Mitsubishi's plants in the central Japanese city of Okaza.

A government spokesman said they were treating the issue as an 'extremely serious case' and that it had ordered the company to submit a full report.	B	Japan's Mitsubishi Motors finds falsified fuel mileage tests
The authorities have set 27 April as the deadline for Mitsubishi Motors to hand over full details of the inaccurate testing.	O	O
The affected cars, the majority of which were only sold in Japan with none being available in the UK, are four mini-car models - the Mitsubishi eK Wagon and eK Space and the Nissan Dayz and Dayz Roox.	O	O

Lance Bradley, managing director at Mitsubishi Motors in the UK said: 'Mitsubishi Motors Corporation has acted quickly and decisively.'We understand that such issues are of great concern to consumers.'I would like to reassure everyone that there is no evidence to suggest that UK or European models are affected.'As a result, Mitsubishi Motors Corp saw its shares fall more than 15 per cent - the biggest drop in over a decade - wiping $1.2 billion from its market value on Wednesday.

Hungary media shake-up enters new phase with closure of major leftist daily
Journalists at Hungary’s main leftist daily Nepszabadsag gathered on Monday to mull ways of resuscitating the paper, with a senior editor saying an abrupt move to close it was meant to silence criticism of the government.	B	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts
Journalists of the leftist newspaper Nepszabadsag, which was unexpectedly shut down on Saturday amid cries of a crackdown by right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, paste a copy of the last issue onto the wall of a temporary newsroom in Budapest, Hungary, October 10, 2016.	O	O
REUTERS/Laszlo BaloghOwner Mediaworks said on Saturday it had suspended the 60-year-old newspaper and its employees after the publication piled up significant losses despite cost cuts.	O	O
It said it would revamp the organization.	O	O
The closure was the latest wrinkle in a shake-up of Hungary’s commercial media landscape, where businessmen seen as close to the right-wing government have steadily enhanced their market share.	B	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts
Since coming to power in 2010, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has locked horns with foreign partners over reforms which critics say have eroded democratic checks and balances and weakened the independence of the media.	O	O
“The Nepszabadsag editorial team wants to stick together and carry on working,” deputy editor in chief Marton Gergely told Reuters in a temporary shared office where staff gathered to discuss approaches to obtaining severance, acquiring the Nepszabadsag brand and securing funds for a fresh news outlet.	O	O
Gergely said that Mediaworks’ business arguments did not hold up as losses appeared relatively small over the last two years and journalists had taken two pay cuts of 10 percent each.	O	O
It was unclear how much money these cuts had saved Mediaworks.	O	O
A Mediaworks statement said the newspaper had incurred losses worth 5 billion forints ($18.4 million) since 2007 due to a fall in circulation, and that it was on track for a “significant” loss this year as well.	B	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts
“We believe the (closure) happened because of what we were doing,” Gergely said.	B	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts
“It is not necessarily due to the coverage of the past one or two weeks.	I	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts
The paper was shut down because they felt we could not be disciplined otherwise.”	I	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts

The right-of-centre Magyar Nemzet said on Wednesday that it would make space available for journalists from centre-left daily Nepszabadsag, "with the aim of making the dissemination of diverse information possible".	O	O
When Nepszabadsag's publisher closed it down suddenly on Saturday, it was widely suggested in the media and opposition ranks that it had acted on government orders, although its owners blamed declining sales.	B	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts

Protests in Hungary at closure of main leftwing opposition newspaper
The state of press freedom in Hungary has come under renewed scrutiny after the country’s main leftwing opposition newspaper was temporarily closed, ostensibly on commercial grounds.	O	O
The decision to suspend publication of Népszabadság by its owners, Mediaworks – who cited the need to seek a viable business model – sparked accusations of a “coup” from the paper’s journalists, many of whom learned of the closure only when they were denied entry to its newsroom in Budapest on Saturday.	B	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts
About 2,000 demonstrators later gathered outside the national parliament to protest against the move.	B	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts
Hungary’s rightwing prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has voiced a desire to establish an “illiberal democracy”, has been repeatedly accused of interfering in the media.	O	O
Mediaworks, which gained total control of Népszabadság last year after buying out the Socialist party’s 27.7% stake, said the decision had been driven by plummeting sales and losses amounting to 5bn Hungarian florints (£14.8m) over the past decade.	O	O
“Népszabadság has lost 74% of its sold circulation in the past 10 years, corresponding to more than 100,000 copies,” the company said in a press release.	O	O
The suspension would enable it to “focus on finding the best business model for the paper, in line with the current trends in the industry, and will start consultations in order to best secure future development,” the statement added.	B	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts
But journalists dismissed the explanation as a smokescreen – pointing out that it came days after the paper disclosed corruption allegations against a minister in Orbán’s Fidesz party and a scandal embroiling the governor of the national bank.	O	O
Népszabadság had also criticised last Sunday’s referendum aimed at demonstrating public opposition to proposals to disperse refugees around EU member states, which overwhelmingly came out in favour of Orbán’s position but on too low a turnout to be valid.	O	O
“Of course they will try and paint this as a business decision but it’s not the truth,” one unnamed journalist told AFP.	B	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts
“Népszabadság was the largest group of quality journalists in Hungary trying to defend basic freedoms, democracy, freedom of speech, and tolerance.	B	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper

“The total undermining of Népszabadság is the latest example of Viktor’s Orbán’s megalomania.	I	Hungary's leading leftist newspaper unexpectedly shuts
The only aim of Fidesz is to either gain 100% control over Hungarian media or to obstruct it,” its spokesman told AP.	O	O
Established in 1956, Népszabadság was controlled by the ruling communist regime until its collapse in 1989.	O	O
The paper’s most recent sales figures were about 40,000, down from 270,000 two decades ago.	O	O

Christine Lagarde said the International Monetary Fund did not conduct negotiations using 'threats' Christine Lagarde insists it is "simply nonsense" that the International Monetary Fund is pushing for a credit crisis to force economic reforms in Greece, responding to a leaked conversation that has sparked fury among the country's politicians.

"It comes after Mr Tsipras demanded "explanations" from the IMF over its attitude towards Greece, following WikiLeaks' publication of an internal teleconference of IMF executives, some of whom are representing negotiations with Greece.	O	O
According to the transcript, the IMF said an "event" was required to force the debt-laden country to decide economic reforms.	B	Greek
The revelations prompted speculation that the organisation is planning on using the threat of default to force Athens to act on its debt burden.	O	O
Alexis Tsipras demanded the IMF reveal its stance on Greece, after a leaked internal conversation suggested it was hoping for an "event" to force reforms  Mr Tsipras immediately sent a letter to Ms Lagarde over the issue.	O	O
"The Greek government is demanding explanations from the IMF over whether seeking to create default conditions in Greece," a spokesman for the country's premier said.	O	O
In her response, issued late on Sunday, the IMF chief said she would only support a "credible" and "realistic" programme that delivers sustainable growth in Greece.	O	O
The country's national debt of more than $300bn has caused significant losses for organisation, as well as for other Eurozone countries.	O	O
Ms Lagarde added that the IMF will deploy a team of experts to Athens to continue discussions with Mr Tspiras to bring a "speedy conclusion" to fiscal targets in the country.	O	O

WikiLeaks said it had obtained details of a discussion last month between the top two IMF officials in charge of managing the Greek debt crisis - Poul Thomsen, the head of the IMF's European Department, and Delia Velkouleskou, the IMF mission chief for Greece.	O	O
The whistle-blowing organisation said the discussion showed that the IMF was planning to tell Germany it will abandon the Troika (composed of the IMF, European Commission and the European Central Bank) if the IMF and the Commission fail to reach an agreement on Greek debt relief.	O	O
The IMF officials say that a threat of an imminent financial catastrophe was needed to force other players into accepting its “measures” such as cutting Greek pensions and working conditions, but that the UK referendum on June 23 will paralyse European decision making at a critical moment, according to the records.

The IMF officials said a threat of an imminent financial catastrophe was needed to help reach a “decision point”, convincing German chancellor Angela Merkel on debt relief and Greece into accepting IMF “measures” against pensions and working conditions, said the transcript.	O	O

Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has accused the IMF of imposing “draconian measures”, including on pension reform.	B	IMF

IMF concerned UK referendum will interfere with Greek bailout \u2013 WikiLeaks
The International Monetary Fund expects that a possible Greek default on its bailout will coincide with the UK’s referendum on membership of the European Union, according to a leaked transcript.	B	UK referendum will interfere with Greek bailout
WikiLeaks said it had obtained details of a discussion last month between the top two IMF officials in charge of managing the Greek debt crisis – Poul Thomsen, the head of the IMF’s European department, and Delia Velculescu, the IMF mission chief for Greece.	O	O
The whistleblowing organisation said the discussion showed that the IMF was planning to tell Germany it will abandon the troika (composed of the IMF, the European commission and the European Central Bank) if the IMF and the commission fail to reach an agreement on Greek debt relief.	O	O
The IMF officials say that a threat of an imminent financial catastrophe was needed to force other players into accepting its measures such as cutting Greek pensions and working conditions, but that the UK referendum on 23 June will paralyse EU decision-making at a critical moment, according to the records.	B	UK referendum
The UK referendum was said to add a complication that needed to be negotiated around – delaying a possible “moment of truth” until after the June vote.	O	O
Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has accused the IMF of imposing draconian measures, including on pension reform.	B	IMF
The transcript quotes Velculescu as saying: “What is interesting though is that [Greece] did give in … they did give a little bit on both the income tax reform and on the … both on the tax credit and the supplementary pensions”.	B	Greek
Thomsen’s view was that the Greeks “are not even getting close [to coming] around to accept our views”.	B	Greek
Velculescu argued that “if [the Greek government] get pressured enough, they would … But they don’t have any incentive and they know that the commission is willing to compromise, so that is the problem.	B	Greek
”WikiLeaks said that in the meeting Velculescu revealed that the IMF is strategising about whether it should release its updated report on the crisis.	O	O

Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is struggling to defend his economy
Financiers from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are prepared to force millions of Greeks into abject poverty to secure a petty political victory over Brussels, according to a leaked conversation between top officials.	O	O
The sordid wrangling shows just how dead Greece's supposed democracy is, with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras now powerless to defend his people from its puppet paymasters in Berlin and Washington, where the IMF is based.	B	Greek
The international lender even wanted to use Britain's EU referendum as an excuse to drive the struggling country to the wall so that it could get its own way.	O	O
Greek politicians have reacted with fury to the revelations, and have demanded immediate answers from IMF boss Christine Lagarde.	B	IMF concerned UK referendum will interfere with Greek bailout
In a response today she astonishingly asked Greece's former finance minister to "respect the privacy" of her staff, but also denied that the organisation would use his country's insolvency as a bargaining chip.	B	IMF concerned UK referendum will interfere with Greek bailout
But in truth they have no power to change the situation, with their country now entirely reliant on international bailouts to stay afloat.	B	Greek
The shocking plot has been revealed in a leaked transcript of a meeting between two top IMF officials released by the whistle blowing website Wikileaks.	O	O
Greece is in the grip of the huge migrant crisisGreece's democracy has been eroded by a tug of war between the IMF and the EUThe conversation, on 19 March, purportedly involves Poul Thomsen, head of the IMF's Europe department, and Delia Velculescu, leader of the IMF team in Greece, who are the senior officials in charge of Greece's debt crisis.	B	Greek
They are apparently discussing how to get the EU - and Angela Merkel in particular - to come around to their way of thinking over a restructuring of Greek debt.	O	O
The IMF says it will only sign up to a deal which involves debt relief for the stricken nation, a position Germany emphatically rejects.	O	O
The two parties are due to meet next week to discuss the next financial instalment for Greece, which will need fresh funding in the summer to avert a costly default.	O	O
Former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis reacted furiously to the revelationsMany Greeks are furious at the stringent conditions attached to international bailoutsDuring the conversation it is apparently suggested that the international lender should be prepared to bring about an "event" - in other words a financial crisis bringing Greece to the point of collapse - to force the issue to a head.	O	O
In the leaked transcript Mr Thomsen is quoted as complaining about the pace of talks on reforms Greece has agreed to carry out in exchange for the bailout.	B	Greek bailout
He asks: "What is going to bring it all to a decision point.	I	Greek bailout
"In the past there has been only one time when the decision has been made and then that was when they were about to run out of money seriously and to default.	B	Greek
"Tue, May 16, 2017Shocking photographs depict clashes between police and protesters Protesters clash with riot police during a protest at Syntagma square, in Athens, Greece, 17 May 2017Ms Velculescu later agrees, saying: "We need an event, but I don't know what that will be".	O	O
Mr Thomsen also appears to suggest the IMF could pull out of the bailout altogether to force German Chancellor Angela Merkel to agree to debt relief.	B	IMF
Such a move could be politically difficult for Mrs Merkel, the key figure in the crisis.	O	O
He says: "Look.	O	O
., Mrs Merkel, you face a question, you have to think about what is more costly: to go ahead without the IMF, would the Bundestag say 'the IMF is not on board	O	O
' or to pick the debt relief that we think that Greece needs in order to keep us on board.	O	O
Right.	O	O
"He adds that, if Greece were to default, talks could be further delayed by Britain's referendum on EU membership.	O	O
Following the revelations former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis raged: "As WikiLeaks revealed today, the IMF is planning to stall until July to bring Greece to its knees again in order to force Angela Merkel's hand.	O	O
"It's time to stop Greece's fiscal waterboarding by an incompetent, misanthropic troika.	B	Greek
"Paul Mason, author of Postcapitalism	O	O
—.	O	O
A Guide to Our Future, added: "It’s clear from the transcript that the IMF has become a playground for neoliberal fantasists.	B	IMF
"To fantasise about inflicting yet another near bankruptcy on a teetering democracy reveals levels of insouciance about the welfare of human beings and the sovereignty of states incompatible with a democratic organisation.	O	O
"It proves, yet again, that the core of the economic doctrine that guides the global elite is the determination not to “give a s***” about real people, but to impose the doctrine even at the cost of state failure.	O	O
"The IMF declined to comment, but said its public position on the matter was clear.	O	O
And in a letter to Mr Varoufakis today, its head Ms Lagarde wrote: “Any speculation that IMF staff would consider using a credit event as a negotiating tactic is simply nonsense.	O	O
“The IMF conducts its negotiations in good faith, not by way of threats, and we do not communicate through leaks.".	O	O

Greece, EU/IMF lenders to resume bailout talks amid tension
Greece and its EU/IMF lenders will resume talks on the country’s fiscal and reform progress this week aiming to bridge differences and conclude a key bailout review, which will pave the way for negotiations on long-desired debt relief.	B	Greek bailout
Euro rally in front of the parliament building, in Athens, Greece, June 30, 2015.	O	O
REUTERS/Yannis BehrakisThe review has been adjourned twice since February, mainly due to a rift among the lenders over the estimated size of Greece’s fiscal gap by 2018, as well as disagreements with Athens on pension reforms and the management of bad loans.	O	O
Inspectors from the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund interrupted the review last month, taking a break for Catholic Easter, government officials said.	O	O
Talks are expected to resume on Monday and Athens hopes for a compromise before April 22, when euro zone finance ministers are expected to assess its progress.	O	O
The IMF is expected to decide whether to co-finance Greece’s third bailout after the review and in light of how much debt relief Greece receives.	O	O
Holding a fragile parliamentary majority, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hopes a debt restructuring will convince Greeks that their sacrifices are paying off after six years of belt-tightening.	O	O
But the delays have cast a shadow on his plans.	O	O
Adding to growing tension, Internet whistleblowing site WikiLeaks published on Saturday what it said was the transcript of a March 19 conference call of three senior IMF officials discussing tactics to apply pressure on Greece, Germany and the EU to reach a deal in April.	O	O
The officials were quoted as discussing a threat that the Fund might not participate in Greece’s third bailout programme as a way to force EU creditors, especially Germany, to reach a deal on debt relief before Britain’s June referendum on whether to stay in the European Union.	O	O
An IMF spokesman in Washington said the Fund did not comment on “leaks or supposed reports of internal discussions” but added that the IMF had made its position known in public.	O	O
The Greek government interpreted the leak as revealing an IMF effort to blackmail Athens with a possible credit event to force it to give in on pension cuts which it has rejected.	B	IMF
Tsipras’s office said he had asked IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde to clarify the Fund’s stance.	O	O
Talks on Monday will focus on measures needed to plug an estimated fiscal gap of 3 percent of GDP by 2018, according to government officials and sources close to the lenders.	O	O
The IMF initially put the figure at 4.5 percent and Athens at 1 percent.	O	O
Athens aims to save one percentage point from cutting pension spending, another point from raising income tax on high income earners and 1 percent of GDP from tax measures, which have not yet been agreed.	O	O
It is also considering raising fuel tax and value-added tax on cigarettes, among other measures.	O	O
If concluded the review will unlock a new tranche of about 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion), which Athens needs to pay state arrears and ECB and IMF maturing debt.	O	O
Greece has no major debt redemptions until July.	O	O

European sovereign debt crisis could cause Eurozone implosion - ex-BoE chiefThe only reason why negotiations last year resulted in a deal between Greece and its creditors was because Athens was “about to run out of money seriously and to default,” Thomsen assumed during the conversation.	O	O

“Because they are not close to the event, whatever it is.	O	O
”“I agree that we need an event, but I don't know what that will be,” Velkouleskou replied, also agreeing that the talks would drag past July, as the UK "Brexit" referendum which is to take place in June 2016 is going to “paralyse European decision making at the critical moment.	O	O
”Greece is “not even getting close” to accepting “our views,” Thomsen added.	B	Greek
However, Velkouleskou said that if Athens is “pressured enough,” they would.	B	Greek
“But they don't have any incentive and they know that the Commission is willing to compromise, so that is the problem,” she added.	I	Greek
Another possibility, on which both agreed, was to tell Germany that IMF will abandon the Troika group (IMF, European Commission and the European Central Bank) if the fund and the Commission fail to reach an agreement on Greek debt relief.	O	O

India's prime minister in Saudi Arabia for first visit
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Saudi King Salman on Sunday during his first official visit to the kingdom, home to a large number of Indian laborers and a major trade partner that supplies around 19 percent of India's crude oil imports.	B	Saudi Arabia
Modi's visit underscored the major business ties between the two countries, despite Saudi Arabia's historically close relationship with India's long-standing rival Pakistan.	B	India's prime minister in Saudi Arabia for first visit
Modi visited Pakistan in December, suggesting a thawing of relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.	O	O
Saudi Arabia is traditionally India's largest supplier of crude oil, and India is one of the world's largest consumers of crude.	O	O
Trade between the two countries reached $39 billion in 2014, according to a joint statement released after Modi's meeting with King Salman.	O	O
Saudi Arabia is seeking to keep its edge over rival Iran, which is looking to increase its own oil exports to India.	O	O
The kingdom is also rushing to diversify its economy as lower global oil prices impact revenue.	O	O
During their meeting, the sides signed five agreements, including plans to cooperate in intelligence sharing related to terror financing and money laundering, as well as a labor cooperation agreement and another to promote bilateral investments in the private sector.	O	O
The two also agreed on the need to intensify defense cooperation through mutual visits by military experts and joint military exercises.	O	O
In a joint statement, Salman and Modi said they strongly condemned terrorism and reject any attempts "to link this universal phenomenon to any particular race, religion or culture.	O	O
"Modi, who has come under fire for his party's links to hard-line Hindu groups, has long had an uneasy relationship with his country's roughly 120 million Muslims.	O	O
Still, Modi gifted King Salman a gold-plated replica of a mosque in Kerala, India that was built by Arab traders in the early 7th Century.	O	O
For his part, Salman awarded Modi Saudi Arabia's highest civilian honor, the King Abdulaziz Sash.	O	O
Modi also met Crown Prince and Interior Minister Mohammed bin Nayef and held one-on-one talks with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir and board chairman of Saudi oil giant Aramco, Abdulaziz al-Faleh, who is also the health minister.	O	O
Earlier Sunday, he spoke at the Saudi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, met members of India's business community and visited an all-female information technology center run by the Indian Tata Consultancy Services in Riyadh.	O	O
Modi kicked off his tour Saturday with a visit to a labor camp where he was pictured eating a traditional South Asian dinner with Indian workers amid tight security.	O	O
India and other South Asian countries supply oil-rich Gulf Arab nations with millions of migrant laborers who take on low-paying jobs as construction workers, waiters, cleaners and drivers — jobs that Gulf nationals have often shunned.	O	O
Many South Asian workers complain of various forms of abuse by their employers, such as having their passports and salaries withheld.	O	O
Modi was quoted on his Twitter account and in Indian media telling the workers Saturday evening in Riyadh that a round-the-clock helpline would be established for them.	O	O
He said his government would create resource centers for Indian workers in Saudi Arabia's two largest cities of Riyadh and Jiddah.	O	O

Modi's Saudi visit part of push to 'de-hyphenate' India from Pakistan
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Saudi Arabia on Sunday is part of a diplomatic effort to put pressure on arch rival Pakistan by forging ties with some of Islamabad’s closest allies, Indian ruling party and government officials said.U.S. Chief of Protocol Ambassador Peter Selfridge (L) greets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he arrives for a working dinner with heads of delegations for the Nuclear Security Summit at the White House in Washington March 31, 2016.	B	India's prime minister in Saudi Arabia for first visit
REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstModi is expected to sign trade agreements, including contracts to secure investment for infrastructure projects, and offer security and military cooperation, such as training and joint exercises, the officials said.	O	O
The Indian premier’s visit is just over seven months after he traveled to another Pakistan ally, the United Arab Emirates, and signed a security cooperation agreement that includes regular meetings between top security advisers.	O	O
“It’s simple.	O	O
We have to do everything to deal with Pakistan - use economics, strategy and emotional ties to win the hearts of Islamabad’s friends,” said Ram Madhav, national general secretary of Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.	O	O
Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence in 1947, two of them over Kashmir.	O	O
New Delhi has long accused Islamabad of sponsoring a separatist movement and militancy in the Himalayan region.	O	O
Pakistan denies the charge and accuses India of occupying Kashmir and fomenting trouble in its restive provinces, like Baluchistan.	O	O
New Delhi has been frustrated that often its ties with countries have been colored by concerns about its relationship with Pakistan.	O	O
One foreign ministry official said the Saudis tended to bring up Pakistan during discussions with India.	B	Saudi Arabia
Government officials described Modi’s diplomatic push as an effort to “de-hyphenate” India from Pakistan, especially as New Delhi tries to play a bigger geopolitical role in Asia to counter China’s influence.	B	India's prime minister in Saudi Arabia for first visit
Stronger relationships with Pakistan’s allies can help India get a more sympathetic hearing on global and regional forums and put pressure on Islamabad to rein in militants.	O	O
On Thursday, Saudi Arabia and the United States imposed joint sanctions targeting the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group blamed for the 2008 attacks in Mumbai.	O	O
In Washington on Friday, where Modi was attending a summit on nuclear security, Indian government spokesman Vikas Swarup welcomed the move.	O	O
“Countries working against terror entities - particularly entities that have targeted India repeatedly - is I think a welcome development,” he told reporters.	O	O
RIGHT TIMING Until now, India’s relationship with Saudi Arabia has been driven primarily by trade and the Indian diaspora in the Middle East.	O	O
Saudi Arabia is India’s top energy supplier and home to more than 3.5 million Indian expatriates.	O	O
Over the past few years, there has been some cooperation on security between the two countries, with Riyadh deporting four most wanted fugitives to India.	O	O
Modi will look to broaden those ties, with one foreign ministry official saying healthcare, education, religious tourism and labor reforms would also be key talking points.	O	O
Still, there are limits to what New Delhi can hope to achieve.	O	O
The relationship between Pakistan and the Saudis goes back decades, based in their shared Sunni Muslim heritage.	O	O
Saudi Arabia has long been a source of financial aid for Islamabad.	B	Saudi Arabia
In 2014, the Saudis gave Pakistan $1.5 billion as a “gift” to shore up its foreign reserves.	O	O
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif spent time in political exile in Saudi Arabia in the 2000s, after he was ousted in a military coup.	O	O
But Indian officials said the timing was right for Modi’s visit, as relations between Riyadh and Islamabad enter a rough patch.	B	India's prime minister in Saudi Arabia for first visit
Pakistan declined to provide ships, aircraft and troops to the Saudi-led fight to halt Iranian-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen last year.	O	O
It has also sought to avoid taking sides in the escalating dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran.	O	O
“Pakistan knows that relations with Saudi have come to a low.	O	O
That doesn’t mean that India can fill that gap,” said Zahid Hussain, a former newspaper editor in Pakistan.	O	O
“But certainly this is part of Modi’s diplomatic offensive in the region.”.	B	India's prime minister in Saudi Arabia for first visit

Khamenei says 'missile and talk' crucial for Iran
Khamenei says 'missile and talk' crucial for IranIran's supreme leader declared the Islamic Republic must advance its missile capabilities while pursuing diplomacy to gain leverage in dealing with world powers - giving a nod to both hardline and moderate factions in the country.	B	Iran
"In talks we must be strong and negotiate in a way not to be deceived," Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday in a statement posted on Twitter.	I	Iran
Khamenei said the situation calls for "both missile and talk" and the country "must use all means" to advance its interests.	I	Iran
Khamenei supported last year's nuclear deal with world powers, but has since called for Iran to avoid further rapprochement with the United States and its allies, while maintaining its economic and military strength.	O	O
"If the Islamic Republic seeks negotiations but has no defensive power, it would have to back down against threats from any weak country," he said in a separate statement posted in his website.	B	Iran
Khamenei's comments came as the United Nations Security Council considers its response to the ballistic missile tests carried out by Iran's Revolutionary Guards earlier this month.	O	O
On Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Iran's missile tests caused "alarm", and it would be up to the Security Council to decide whether new sanctions should be applied.	B	missile program
Last Saturday, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif defended its effort to boost the country's missile arsenal saying recent tests did not violate the nuclear deal with the West.	O	O
Missile deterence'In an interview with Al Jazeera, Mohammad Marandi, a professor at the University of Tehran, said Iran needs to keep "a strong missile deterence" in the face of external security threats.	B	Iran
"Iranians know that the only reason why in the last couple of decades no one has dared to attack the country is because it has the capability to defend itself," said Marandi.	I	Iran
The US and several European powers insisted the recent tests defied UN Security Council Resolution 2231 that calls on Iran not to test nuclear-capable missiles, according to a joint letter seen by Reuters news agency on Tuesday.	B	missile program

Khamenei defends Iran's missile programme as UN concerns mount
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, has firmly defended the country’s missile programme in the face of rising concerns among members of the UN security council.	O	O
The 76-year-old ayatollah, who is also the country’s commander-in-chief, said in a speech on Wednesday that Tehran would lose its leverage in negotiations with the world’s major powers if it were to abandon its missile programme.	B	Iran
“These are times of both missiles and negotiations,” he said.	O	O
“If the Islamic establishment seeks technology and negotiations but does not have defensive power, it will have to back down in the face of any petty country that threatens it,” Khamenei said, according to the state-run Press TV.	B	Iran
Khamenei, who has the final word on all state matters, was speaking to religious eulogists in Tehran a day after it emerged that the US and its European allies in the security council have written a joint letter warning that recent missile tests by Iran were in defiance of a UN security council resolution adopting last year’s nuclear agreement.	O	O
The letter, which claimed that Iranian missiles were “inherently capable of delivering nuclear weapons”, was carefully drafted and did not say, however, that the tests violated the accord itself, which would have serious implications on its implementation.	B	missile program
Russia has disagreed with fundamental outlines of the letter.	O	O
Earlier in March, the elite Revolutionary Guards claimed to have successfully tested two ballistic missiles, Qadr-H and Qadr-F, during large-scale drills.	O	O
The Fars news agency, which is affiliated to the guards, said the missiles carried a message in Hebrew written on them: “Israel must vanish from the page of time.	O	O
”Iran maintains that its missile programme is developed for defensive purposes and has nothing to do with its nuclear programme.	O	O
The issue was not included as part of the two-year negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement signed last July in Vienna and was therefore expected to remain a bone of contention despite progress on the nuclear front.	O	O
The US last week imposed new sanctions on two Iranian groups believed to have contributed to the country’s missile programme.	O	O
From the beginning of the nuclear talks, Tehran resisted efforts by the west to include the missile programme as part of the negotiations, saying that the matter was military-related and outside the jurisdiction of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.	O	O
In his Wednesday speech, Khamenei also reprimanded internal critics.	O	O
“That they say the future of the world is one of negotiation and not one of missiles,” the ayatollah said, “if that is said out of ignorance, well it is ignorance, but if it’s said knowingly, it is treason.	O	O
” He was invoking, almost word for word, a recent tweet by Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, the head of the country’s expediency council, who had said that “the future of the world is one of dialogue, not missiles”.	O	O
The two ayatollahs have been at odds in recent years over many domestic and foreign issues.	O	O
Rafsanjani was not allowed to run for the presidency in 2013 and one of his sons, Mehdi, is serving a jail term for corruption.	O	O
Rafsanjani, however, came at the top of the list of winners in recent elections for the assembly of experts, which is in charge of appointing the next supreme leader.	O	O
“The Islamic Republic must use all tools,” Khamenei said.	B	Iran
“I am not opposed to political dialogue, not with everyone of course. I am fine with political dialogue on the level of global issues.	O	O
These are times of both missiles and negotiations.	O	O
”Khamenei is ostensibly unhappy with the outcomes so far of Iranian sanctions being lifted as the result of the nuclear deal.	O	O
Big European banks, in particular, are still reluctant to handle Iranian payments due to existing US non-nuclear sanctions relating to terrorism.	O	O
“Negotiations should be carried out in such a way that we do not get cheated,” Khamenei said.	O	O
“That we negotiate, put things on paper, but sanctions don’t get removed and trade doesn’t get going is a sign that something is wrong.”.	O	O

Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei: Missile program trumps talk
In a bold speech clearly aimed at Western negotiators and Iran's moderate political wing, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared Wednesday his rogue nation would remain strong through its missile program -- not through talks with other countries.	B	Iran
"Those who say the future is in negotiations, not in missiles, are either ignorant or traitors," Iran's spiritual leader said in a speech carried on his website.	O	O
Earlier this month, Iran's Revolutionary Guard reportedly test-fired two ballistic missiles with the phrase "Israel must be wiped out" written in Hebrew on them, the latest in a string of missile tests that violated a United Nations Security Council resolution supporting the nuclear deal reached by Iran, the U.S. and other western nations.	O	O
The launch happened while Vice President Joe Biden was visiting Israel.	O	O
The much-publicized deal aims to ease sanctions on Iran in exchange for the scaling back of its nuclear program.	O	O
Secretary of State John Kerry told MSNBC in January that U.S. allies in Israel were safer as a result of the deal, adding, "The world is safer today.	O	O
"Kerry said two weeks ago that the latest Iran missile tests "could invite additional sanctions as we put them in place.	B	missile program
"Iran's lead negotiators for the deal were moderate president Hassan Rouhani and his administration -- not the ayatollah.	O	O
"If the Islamic Republic seeks negotiations but has no defensive power, it would have to back down against threats from any weak country," Khamenei said Wednesday.	B	missile program
There was no immediate reaction from the State Department.	O	O
After the latest test-launches, State Department spokesman John Kirby vowed to bring them to the attention of the United Nations Security Council, saying, “We’re not going to turn a blind eye to this and we’re not at all trying to make any excuses for it.	B	missile program
”Khamenei's speech may have been sparked by a tweet from moderate former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani who claimed, "the future is in dialogue, not missiles," according to Reuters.	O	O
Hard-liners in Iran's military have fired rockets and missiles despite U.S. objections since the deal, and have shown underground missile bases on state television.	O	O
They insist their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.	O	O
In October, Iran successfully test-fired a new guided long-range ballistic surface-to-surface missile.	O	O
It was the first such test since Iran and world powers reached the landmark deal last summer.U.N. experts said the launch used ballistic missile technology banned under a Security Council resolution.	O	O
In January, the U.S. imposed new sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the ballistic missile program.	O	O
Iran also has fired rockets near U.S. warships and flown an unarmed drone over an American aircraft carrier in recent months.	O	O
In January, Iran seized 10 U.S. sailors in the Gulf when their two riverine command boats headed from Kuwait to Bahrain ended up in Iranian territorial waters after the crews "misnavigated," the U.S. military said.	O	O
The sailors were taken to a small port facility on Farsi Island, held for about 15 hours and released after Kerry spoke several times with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.	O	O

Israel rejects 'shameful' UN resolution amid criticism of Netanyahu
Israel has responded furiously to a UN security council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, recalling two of its ambassadors to countries that voted for the motion and threatening to cut aid.	O	O
The security council adopted the landmark resolution demanding Israel halt all settlement building and expansion in the occupied territories after Barack Obama’s administration refused to veto the resolution on Friday.	O	O
A White House official said Obama had taken the decision to abstain in the absence of any meaningful peace process.	O	O
The resolution, which passed by a 14-0 vote, was met with loud applause in the packed chamber after the US ambassador, Samantha Power, abstained.	B	U.N. resolution on halting settlements
The move was immediately condemned as “shameful” by the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.	O	O
A spokesman pointedly referred to Israel’s expectation of working more closely with the US president-elect, Donald Trump.	O	O
On Saturday Netanyahu said Israel would reassess its ties with the UN and had ordered a review of the funding of UN institutions and the presence of UN representatives in Israel.	O	O
“I have already instructed to stop about 30m shekels (£6.3m) in funding to five UN bodies that are especially hostile to Israel and there is more to come,” he said, without giving any further details.	O	O
The security council last adopted a resolution critical of settlements in 1979, with the US abstaining then too.	O	O
The US vetoed a similar resolution in 2011, which was the sole veto cast by the Obama administration at the security council.	O	O
US abstains from UN vote to end Israeli settlement building Amid emerging criticism of the handling of the vote by Netanyahu, whose manoeuvres were seen as an attempt to sideline Obama and his administration, Israel ordered action against a number of countries.	O	O
The response included the recall of the Israeli ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, who voted for the resolution, the cancellation of a planned visit by the Senegalese foreign minister to Israel in three weeks’ time, and the cancellation of all aid programmes to Senegal.	O	O
New Zealand’s foreign minister, Murray McCully, said his country’s vote should have been no surprise to Israel.	O	O
“We have been very open about our view that the [security council] should be doing more to support the Middle East peace process and the position we adopted today is totally in line with our long-established policy on the Palestinian question,” he said.	B	U.N.
The UK, France, Russia and China also voted in favour of the resolution, which described Israeli settlement building as a “flagrant violation” of international law.	B	settlements
The vote has sharply underlined the extent of Israel’s international isolation under Netanyahu, and in particular the hollowness of Netanyahu’s boast at the UN general assembly in the autumn over Israel’s purported diplomatic advances at the UN, not least among African members.	O	O
While Israel may expect a much easier ride after the inauguration of Donald Trump, support for the motion from countries such as the UK and France demonstrates the deep frustration in Europe with the policies of Netanyahu’s rightwing coalition over settlements and the moribund peace process.	O	O
For its part, the Obama administration made clear that the US decision to abstain was in direct response to choices made by Netanyahu on settlements.	O	O
The resolution also serves as a warning to the incoming Trump administration over its policies after the selection by Trump of a far-right pro-settler, David Friedman, to be ambassador to Israel.	O	O
While the US and EU have worked closely together in coordinating foreign policy on the Israel-Palestine question, there has been growing support among European governments for tougher steps against Israel, which has already resulted in a directive on the labelling of settlement products.	O	O
The strength of the language in the resolution reiterating the illegality of Jewish settlements built on land intended for a Palestinian state, occupied by Israel in 1967, is likely to have an impact on multinational companies operating in the occupied territories or working with Israeli enterprises with links to the occupied territories.	O	O
Although the resolution is not binding in legal terms, it will have other practical effects, not least in the impact it may have on the Palestinian complaint to the international criminal court, which includes Israeli settlements.	O	O
The resolution also includes language calling for differential treatment of Israel within the pre-1967 borders, calling on states to “distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967”, which could potentially pave the way for future sanctions.	O	O
Israeli supporters in the US – both senators and lobby groups – were aghast.	O	O
Morton Klein, the president of the rightwing Zionist Organization of America, railed in unequivocal terms: “Obama has made it clear that he’s a Jew-hating antisemite.	O	O
”Leading pro-Israel Republicans also weighed in, including the House speaker, Paul Ryan, who denounced the US abstention as “absolutely shameful” and promised that “our unified Republican government will work to reverse the damage done by this administration, and rebuild our alliance with Israel”.	O	O
In Israel, however, questions were being asked about Netanyahu’s handling of the vote.	O	O
Writing in Haaretz, the columnist Chemi Shalev was particularly scathing about Netanyahu’s diplomatic failure.	O	O
“Resolution 2334 shatters the [Israeli] government-induced illusion that the settlement project has been normalised, that it passed the point of no return, that it is now a fait accompli that will remain unchallenged,” he wrote.	O	O
“In recent years, after President Obama desisted from efforts to advance the peace process, Netanyahu, his ministers and settler leaders had behaved as if the battle was over: Israel built and built, the White House objected and condemned, the facts on the ground were cemented in stone.	O	O
“You can have your cake and eat it too, the government implied: thumb your nose at Washington and the international community, build in the West Bank as if there’s no tomorrow and still get $38bn in unprecedented [US] military aid.”.	O	O

Two of Turkey's key conditions for normalisation - an apology and compensation - were largely met earlier, leaving its third demand, that Israel lift its blockade on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, the main obstacle left.	O	O
Reports in recent days described a compromise on the issue.	O	O
Under the reported terms of the deal, Israel will allow the completion of a much-needed hospital in Gaza, as well as the construction of a new power station and a desalination plant for drinking water.	O	O
Turkey's aid to Gaza would also be channelled through the Israeli port of Ashdod rather than sending it directly to the Palestinian enclave, the reports said.	O	O
Turkey has long insisted that closing the file on the flotilla raid should include an end to Israeli restrictions on trade with Gaza.	O	O
In this context Turkey has demanded, and Israel has rejected, "unrestricted access" to Gaza for Turkish assistance and trade.	O	O
Israel has also committed to depositing some $20m in a fund for compensation for the Turkish victims' families, the Israeli official told AFP, ending all claims against Israeli soldiers.	O	O
On the other hand, Turkey has committed to keeping Hamas from carrying out activities against Israel from its country, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.	O	O
Hamas would continue to be able to operate from Turkey for diplomatic purposes, the paper said.	O	O
Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, has said it was not involved in Turkey's decision to normalise ties with Israel, but its officials hope the deal will have a wider impact across the Palestinian territories.	O	O
Netanyahu has come under pressure within Israel not to agree to the deal if it does not include provisions for Hamas to hand over four missing Israelis, including the remains of two soldiers presumed dead and two civilians believed held alive by Hamas in Gaza.	O	O
The Israeli official told AFP that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to instruct "all relevant Turkish agencies to help resolve the issue of Israel's missing citizens".	O	O
Previously tight relations between Israel and Turkey were significantly downgraded after Israeli commandos staged a botched pre-dawn raid on the six-ship flotilla in May 2010.	O	O
Nine activists aboard the Turkish-owned Mavi Marmara ferry were killed, with a 10th person later dying of his wounds.	O	O
Israel imposed its blockade on Gaza in June 2006 after Palestinian fighters there kidnapped an Israeli soldier.	O	O
The restrictions were tightened a year later when Hamas took control of the enclave.	O	O
There have been three wars between Israel and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza since 2008, including a devastating 50-day conflict in the summer of 2014.	O	O

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.	O	O
Israel and Turkey have reached a deal to normalize diplomatic relations, six years after an Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla left eight Turks and an American citizen of Turkish origin dead.	O	O
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim announced Monday that the deal, set to be signed Tuesday, includes a $20 million compensation fund for Turkish families, an eventual return of ambassadors and initial talks on a possible natural gas pipeline.	O	O
Under the deal, Turkey will end all criminal or civil claims against Israeli military personnel and the State of Israel following the 2010 Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound Turkish aid flotilla that left nine people dead, Netanyahu said at a press conference in Rome where officials hammered out the agreement.	O	O
The blockade on the Gaza Strip remains in place but Turkey will be able to deliver humanitarian supplies through the Ashdod port in Israel, Netanyahu said.	O	O
A Turkish ship carrying 10,000 tons of aid will move towards Ashdod on Friday, Yildirim said.	O	O
Turkey will also build a water treatment facility, a 200-bed hospital and a power plant in Gaza.	O	O
Turkish and Israeli officials reached the agreement after a year working on it in Rome.	O	O
Both sides had been cautiously optimistic about reaching an agreement, but serious sticking points remained between the two countries, which have suffered years of strained relations.	B	Israel, Turkey restore ties
Turkey had demanded that Israel lift its blockade of Gaza before normalizing relations, while Israel demanded that Turkey prevent Hamas leaders from operating within the country.	O	O
Under the agreement, Turkey will deliver humanitarian aid and nonmilitary supplies to Gaza while making infrastructure investments, according to a senior Turkish official, who said Hamas was not mentioned in the agreement.	O	O
Relations between the two countries soured in May 2010 when Israeli commandos raided the Mavi Marmara, a ship bound for Gaza.	O	O
Turkey had long been Israel's closest ally in the region, but the raid marked the end of normal diplomatic relations, as both countries pulled their ambassadors in the wake of the incident.	O	O
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized for the raid in March 2013, acknowledging "operational mistakes.	O	O
" At the time, many analysts predicted a thaw in relations, but that didn't materialize until now.	O	O
The reconciliation is as much driven by economics as politics.	O	O
When the negotiations were made public in December, part of the discussions included a proposed natural gas pipeline from Israel to Turkey and the sale of natural gas.	O	O
Israel has vast untapped offshore natural gas fields that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to develop, while Turkey finds itself in need of a natural gas supplier after relations with Russia - its primary supplier - soured late last year.	O	O
President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry encouraged the reconciliation and worked to bring the two countries together, since both are key American allies in the region.	O	O
Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Netanyahu on the phone Sunday night, where he "congratulated the Prime Minister for progress toward reconciliation with Turkey, noting the significant positive security and economic benefits for both countries.	O	O
"CNN's Oren Liebermann reported from Jerusalem and Gul Tuysuz reported from Turkey for this story.	O	O

(EPA)On Monday, the two eastern Mediterranean powers sought to move past the emotionally charged dispute over Israel’s blockade of Gaza and Erdogan’s support for Hamas, as they unveiled a deal to normalize diplomatic relations.	B	Israel, Turkey restore ties
The pact arrives six years after nine Turkish activists were killed by Israeli naval forces on the deck of the Mavi Marmara, a boat that challenged Israel’s blockade of the Palestinian territory.	O	O
The detente could end diplomatic bickering and restore a degree of cooperation between two key U.S. allies in the region.	B	Israel, Turkey restore ties
For Erdogan, now Turkey’s president, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the deal is aimed at erasing growing international isolation and, perhaps, opening the door to a strategically significant energy alliance between two countries, political experts say.	B	Israel, Turkey restore ties
Indeed, within hours of the deal's announcement, Turkey and Russia said they had also reached a reconciliation over Ankara's downing of a Russian jet last year.	O	O
Holding simultaneous press conferences in Rome and Ankara, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Netanyahu said that restoring ties would benefit both countries while providing badly needed aid to the Gaza Strip.	O	O
Still, the separate announcements and the lack of any mutual niceties served as a sign of the enduring tensions between Israel's right wing administration and Ankara's Islamist government – which seeks to reassert its leadership role in the Muslim world.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Rome on June 27, 2016.

The sides agreed to return their ambassadors and Israel agreed to pay $20 million in compensation to the families of the Mavi Marmara victims on condition that Turkey drop any charges against the soldiers who participated in the raid, Yildirim said.	O	O
Turkey, meanwhile, dropped a longstanding demand that Israel lift its blockade on the Gaza Strip and Israel agreed to let Turkey ship badly needed building materials for a new hospital and other building projects – part of a several-year reconstruction effort following the wars between Hamas and Israel.	O	O
Netanyahu said that the deal included a commitment from Turkey to prevent militant activities by Hamas on its soil, and to assist in efforts to return the remains of Israeli soldiers held in Gaza since the 2014 war.	O	O
The Turkish prime minister argued that Turkish aid shipments will mean the de facto lifting of Israel's blockade on the Gaza, the impoverished coastal territory that is home to 1.8 million Palestinians.	O	O
The agreement, he said, will give "breathing room" for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, and demonstrate Ankara's role as a "defender" of the Palestinians.	B	Israel, Turkey restore ties
He said that shipment of 10,000 tons of aid is supposed to depart Turkey later this week.	O	O
An official from the Western-backed Palestinian government in the West Bank criticized the pact, saying it leaves Israel's blockade in place and treats Gaza as a separate political entity.	O	O
"It's not in the interest of Palestine,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization.	O	O
"It's in the interest of Turkey and Israel and maybe Hamas.	O	O
""Both leaders find themselves leading strong countries which are quite isolated….	O	O
That's what pushing them into each other's arms,'' said Alon Liel, a former Israeli envoy to Turkey.	O	O
"Still, it's not all hugs and kisses.	O	O
It will be difficult to reach a full recovery because there are a lot of scars and grievances, and its filtered down to the people.".	O	O

Back in July 2013, a barrel of oil was selling for around $98 in the U.S. when the Qatar-backed Al Jazeera announced with huge ambitions the launch of a cable channel in America that would rival CNN and Fox News.	O	O
Less than three years later, with oil selling for $30 a barrel on U.S. markets, the owners pulled the plug on Al Jazeera America, citing a business model that was "simply not sustainable.	B	Al Jazeera America
" One knowledgeable observer estimated the total loss at nearly $2 billion.	B	Al Jazeera America
In a memo to employees Wednesday, the network said it was shutting down by the end of April.	B	Al Jazeera America
Al Jazeera America debuted in August 2013 to much fanfare, promising to deliver quality, in-depth content as an alternative to the shouting heads featured prominently on other cable news channels.	O	O
Backed by the riches of the Qatar government, Al Jazeera America gained its foothold in the competitive U.S. media market through the $500 million purchase of Current TV, the struggling cable news network founded by Al Gore.	B	Al Jazeera America
But Al Jazeera hit a roadblock almost immediately when cable companies, including Time Warner Cable (TWC) and AT&T (T), refused to carry the channel, saying they had signed distribution agreements with Current TV, not Al Jazeera.	B	Al Jazeera America
Al Jazeera America also suffered from dismal ratings, despite hiring such high-profile (and presumably high-priced) on-air talent as Joie Chen, Ali Velshi and Mike Viqueira.	B	Al Jazeera America
The network eventually found its way into 60 million U.S. homes, compared to the 100 million households that have cable, but viewers rarely tuned in.	O	O
Prime-time ratings sometimes struggled to hit 30,000 viewers, a paltry number compared to the big-three cable news channels.	O	O
Millennials -- highly coveted by advertisers -- made up perhaps a quarter of the audience, according to the Hollywood Reporter.	O	O
Play VideoThe network's demise reportedly was fueled by the cascading price of crude oil.	O	O
A source at Al Jazeera Media Group at the company's headquarters said Al Jazeera was considering companywide cuts because of falling oil prices.	B	Al Jazeera America
Rather than make such across-the-board cuts, the company instead opted to chop Al Jazeera America, the source said.	B	Al Jazeera
Internal strife contributed to the network's woes.	O	O
An exodus of top executives last year along with a pair of lawsuits filed by former employees, which included complaints about sexism and anti-Semitism, only contributed to employee morale problems.	O	O
The network's founding CEO Ehab Al Shihabi, who was accused of fostering a "culture of fear," was ousted last May and replaced by Al Anstey, who had been managing director of Al Jazeera English since 2010.	O	O
Morale improved with Anstey's arrival as CEO, but it was perhaps too little too late.	O	O
Ratings remained dismal, but ultimately, it appears the sinking price of oil was the network's death knell.	B	Al Jazeera America

As Al Jazeera prepared to launch in 2013, it hired several well-known journalists -- Ali Velshi, Joie Chen and Mike Viqueira, to name a few - and vowed that its deep pockets would sustain the operations despite sluggish ratings that were expected at the outset.	O	O
AJAM, as the U.S. operation came to be known, promised to spend money for investigative and fact-based journalism to distinguish itself from more entrenched competitors.	O	O
While some hoped Al Jazeera's international origins and focus would lead the American offshoot to provide broaden coverage of the Middle East and overseas events, AJAM sought to focus on domestic news in hopes of expanding its influence in the U.S.	B	Al Jazeera America
But critics were vocal from day one, lambasting Al Jazeera for buying its way into the U.S. to spread what they saw as its anti-Western and anti-Semitic bias.	B	Al Jazeera
Al Jazeera officials have denied consistently that the company was anti-Western, saying that viewers would change their minds if they gave the upstart operation a fair shot.	B	Al Jazeera
Some cable distributors initially refused to carry the network after Current TV's operation was superseded by AJAM.	B	Al Jazeera America
After lawsuits, AJAM expanded its reach to about 55 million homes in the U.S.	O	O
But ratings failed to grow.	O	O
AJAM never disclosed ratings data, but industry analysts speculated that it never broke six digits.	O	O
Management problems and labor issues also plagued its New York headquarters and other bureaus.	O	O
In May, Al Jazeera fired AJAM CEO Ehab Al Shihabi soon after The New York Times published a story that chronicled "a deep dysfunction" in management and "the culture of fear" engendered by his leadership.	O	O
AJAM also was hit with a lawsuit from a former employee alleging sexism and anti-Semitism.	O	O
Anstey, an Al Jazeera veteran, replaced Al Shihabi and promised more transparency.	O	O
But beyond the problems he inherited, Anstey also has had to deal with efforts by digital staffers to obtain collective bargaining rights.	O	O
In October, about 50 journalists voted to unionize in the face of opposition from management.	O	O
Despite the turmoil, AJAM won some awards for investigative journalism.	O	O
Late last year, it produced a documentary that linked Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning to human growth hormone.	O	O
As the report encountered criticism for its sourcing, the reporters who worked on the story insisted that its main premise -- mainly that growth hormone was sent to Manning's wife in Florida -- is true.	O	O
Manning, one of the most respected and popular NFL football players, hasn't ruled out suing AJAM.	O	O
Jokes about Manning's hand in AJAM's demise surfaced quickly on Twitter Wednesday.	O	O
"Al Jazeera is shutting down," a tweet read, accompanied by a reference to the jingle of Nationwide, an insurance company whose ad spokesman is Manning.	O	O

Abbott Laboratories, a healthcare product manufacturer, has received U.S. antitrust approval to complete its proposed acquisition of St.	O	O
Jude Medical after agreeing to sell two device businesses, the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday.	O	O
Abbott, the Lake Bluff, Ill.-based company that makes pharmaceuticals and medical devices, announced in April that it plans to pay $25 billion acquire St.Jude, a company known for its pacemakers and heart valves.	B	St. Jude acquisition
Federal antitrust regulators objected to the proposal, concerned that the combined company would control more than 70% of the market for vascular closure devices.	B	St. Jude acquisition
The closure devices are used to close holes in arteries from the insertion of catheters, and for steerable sheaths, which guide catheters for treating heart arrhythmias.	O	O
The FTC noted that St.Jude, based in Little Canada, Minn., has had “a near-monopoly” in the market for steerable sheaths for more than a decade.	B	St. Jude

Freedom House, a U.S.-based organization that promotes freedom and democracy, estimates only 5% to 30% of Cubans have any kind of Internet access, meaning Cuba "continues to have some of the most restrictive Internet access in the world.	B	Cuba
"The Cuban government has long restricted Internet access on the island.	O	O
It wasn't until after Cuban President Raúl Castro took power from his ailing brother Fidel in 2008 that Cubans were even allowed to own cellphones or home computers.	O	O
Even then, finding Internet service remained difficult.	O	O
ETECSA recently created WiFi hot spots in some of Cuba's biggest cities, allowing residents to sit in parks and plazas to get online.	O	O
But that service is very expensive for Cubans — about $2 an hour, compared to the monthly Cuban salary of $25 a month.	O	O
ETECSA is also experimenting with providing Internet service directly to people's homes and businesses, but that only began this year, and Cubans say it can cost hundreds of dollars a month.	O	O
"The fact that now the 3% of Cubans who do have access can do faster searches and watch videos, that's a good thing," said Jose Azel of the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami.	B	Cuba

It\u2019s About To Get Harder For Companies To Hide Union-Busting
The Department of Labor says that between 71 to 87 percent of employers hire consultants to help manage union avoidance campaigns.	B	persuader
“This rule will pull back the curtain on the consultants who craft the employer’s message,” said Labor Secretary Thomas Perez.	B	union 'persuader' rule
A lot of U.S. companies pay top dollar just to keep labor unions out of their workplaces.	B	union
It’s hard to know exactly how much — or who — they pay, because the reporting standards aren’t all that strict.	O	O
But that’s about to change.	O	O
On Wednesday, the Labor Department announced a final version of its contentious “persuader” rule.	O	O
Persuaders are lawyers and consultants hired by companies to discourage workers from unionizing.	B	persuader
The art — sometimes subtle, sometimes not — is known as “union avoidance.	I	persuader
” Unions, though, have a more derisive term for it: union-busting.	I	persuader
Employers are already required to report to the federal government any direct work these consultants do on their behalf — that is, any talks or presentations the consultants personally deliver to workers.	O	O
However, consultants can also advise company supervisors on what to say to workers and how to say it, thus bypassing the reporting requirements with behind-the-scenes work that doesn’t have to be disclosed.	B	persuader
Until now.	O	O
Under the new rule, employers and their contractors will have to acknowledge any indirect “persuading” that was done and the fee structure for it.	B	union 'persuader' rule
For example, if a lawyer helps a company craft a video presentation that paints unionizing as a bad idea, or drafts a speech for a manager, then both parties will have to inform the agency that they had a relationship and report how much money changed hands.	I	union 'persuader' rule
In a call with reporters ahead of the rule’s announcement, Labor Secretary Tom Perez said the idea behind the rule was basic transparency.	B	union 'persuader' rule
If an employer’s message during a union campaign is being shaped by outsiders, he said, then the employees who will be voting in the union election have a right to know that.	O	O
“Informed decisions are the best decisions,” Perez said.	O	O
“This rule will pull back the curtain on the consultants who craft the employer’s message.	B	union 'persuader' rule
”According to the Labor Department, employers have been capitalizing on a “huge loophole.	O	O
” The agency says that between 71 to 87 percent of employers hire consultants to help manage union avoidance campaigns, yet the agency gets “very few reports” on that work because consultants consider it exempt from reporting.	B	persuader
The new persuader rule has been in the works for about five years — a fairly long time, even by the standards of federal rule-making, which can often get bogged down in seemingly endless review.	B	union 'persuader' rule
Business lobbies have opposed the rule, since employers would rather not make such disclosures.	B	union 'persuader' rule
The American Bar Association has also objected to the rule on the grounds of attorney-client privilege, but the Labor Department says companies won’t have to report the substance of their discussions with lawyers — only that lawyers were consulted.	B	union 'persuader' rule
In a statement Wednesday, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade lobby for large retailers, said the rule would discourage employers from taking the “reasonable step” of hiring outside consultants to deal with union drives.	B	union 'persuader' rule
“[The Labor Department] is putting employers in a no-win situation where seeking the guidance they need will almost certainly be used against them by organizers,” the group said.	B	Labor Department
Not surprisingly, unions and worker groups have pushed hard for the new rule.	B	union 'persuader' rule
During the George W.	O	O
Bush years, the Labor Department expanded financial reporting requirements for unions, and likewise, unions have sought to expand reporting requirements for corporations during the Obama years.	O	O
Michael Wasser, senior policy analyst at the worker group Jobs with Justice, said it’s important for employees to know who’s trying to sway them.	B	persuader
“There’s an irony here.	O	O
It’s a standard talking point for management in any union campaign to say, ‘We just want employees to know they’re making an informed decision,’” Wasser said.	O	O
“The reality is that under the current rule, they aren’t making an informed decision, because the company isn’t disclosing this third party who’s making these claims and running this campaign that’s influencing workers’ decisions.”.	O	O

Labor Department unveils controversial union 'persuader' rule
The Department of Labor on Wednesday released a long-awaited rule requiring companies to disclose when they seek advice about countering union campaigns, which several business groups vowed to challenge in court.	B	Labor Department unveils union 'persuader' rule
The so-called persuader rule, first proposed in 2011, amends the federal Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act to require detailed reports from employers and their advisers, including the types of consulting or legal services rendered and any fees paid.	B	union 'persuader' rule
For more than 50 years, the reporting law required such disclosure from employers only when their lawyers or consultants interacted directly with workers.	O	O
The Department of Labor said in a memo accompanying the rule that workers would be better prepared to make decisions about unionizing if they knew who was behind their employers’ arguments.	B	union
The rule is backed by major unions, including the Service Employees International Union and the AFL-CIO.	B	union 'persuader' rule
Activities covered by the rule include hiring consultants or lawyers to create materials and policies for organizing anti-union campaigns or script managers’ communications with employees.	I	union 'persuader' rule
The proposal has come under attack from groups including the U.S.Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which say it would stifle employers’ free speech rights to counter union organizing, and the American Bar Association, which says it could interfere with attorney-client privilege.	B	union 'persuader' rule
The rule is the latest salvo in the business community’s battle with the Obama administration over labor policy.	B	union 'persuader' rule
Business groups compared the proposal with rules adopted last year by the National Labor Relations Board to speed up the union election process, saying both provide little benefit to workers while burdening employers.	B	union 'persuader' rule
Several business groups on Wednesday said they would probably sue over the persuader rule.	B	union 'persuader' rule
They said it could discourage some companies from consulting lawyers at all, potentially leading them to commit inadvertent labor violations during union campaigns.	I	union 'persuader' rule
“The DOL must have created this rule with the real intent of assisting organized labor because they are the only ones who stand to gain anything from this,” said Robert Cresanti, president and chief executive officer of the International Franchise Association, one of the groups that says it is considering a court challenge.	B	union 'persuader' rule
Pushback was also expected from Republicans in Congress.	B	union 'persuader' rule
Representative John Kline of Minnesota, who chairs the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that the rule was unfair because it did not impose the same disclosure requirements on unions.	B	union 'persuader' rule

US businesses attack new labor rule aimed at curbing union-busting tactics
The US Department of Labor has announced the final version of a new rule that would require companies to disclose any arrangements they have with outside consultants that seek to persuade workers not to unionize or back their union’s bargaining stance.	B	Labor Department unveils union 'persuader' rule
Business groups attacked the new regulation while the Labor Department said it was merely seeking to close a longtime loophole in the regulations for a 1959 law that sought to require more disclosure by unions and employers.	B	union 'persuader' rule
With the number of union avoidance consultants exploding since the 1970s, labor unions have long urged the labor department to issue a tougher “persuader rule” because the 1959 law – the Landrum-Griffin Act – requires disclosure by any outside consultant that seeks “directly or indirectly to persuade employees” not to form a union.	O	O
“Workers should know who is behind an anti-union message.	B	persuader
It’s a matter of basic fairness,” said Labor secretary Thomas Perez.	O	O
“This new rule will allow workers to know whether the messages they’re hearing are coming directly from their employer or from a paid, third-party consultant.	B	union 'persuader' rule
”The Labor Department said a regulation dating since 1959 had created a loophole by stating that persuaders’ activities had to be disclosed and reported only if a consultant spoke directly with employees, but not if the consultant communicated indirectly with employees – for instance, by writing anti-union pamphlets or speeches that were given by managers.	O	O
According to the department, the new rule closes the loophole by requiring reporting on “actions, conduct or communications that are undertaken with an object, explicitly or implicitly, directly or indirectly, to affect an employee’s decisions regarding his or her representation or collective bargaining rights”.	B	union 'persuader' rule
The door-to-door union killers: rightwing foundation takes labor fight to the streets	O	O
Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, the main US labor federation, applauded the regulation.	B	union 'persuader' rule
“This long-awaited rule will increase transparency about employers’ activities when they hire outside third parties to do their union busting,” he said.	I	union 'persuader' rule
“Working men and women deserve to know who their employer is hiring and exactly how much they are spending to discourage workers from forming a union.	O	O
”An association of small businesses called the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace criticized the new rule, saying it was disappointed that the Labor Department had ignored “the thousands of comments submitted by small business”.	B	union 'persuader' rule
“This rule is unfair to employers,” the coalition said, adding that the regulation will “make it harder for them to lawfully communicate with employees about unions and other workforce issues.	I	union 'persuader' rule
At the same time, the rule effectively limits the information employees receive on important workplace issues, including whether or not to join a union.	I	union 'persuader' rule
”The Retail Industry Leaders Association also attacked the rule, saying it “is designed to discourage employers from taking the reasonable step of hiring outside counsel to ensure that they are complying with labor laws”.	B	union 'persuader' rule
But Labor Department officials said lawyers will be required to disclose anti-union activities only if they give advice on dissuading workers from unionizing – and not if the advice is purely legal, such as advising employers on what steps might violate the National Labor Relations Act.	B	persuader
In a 2009 study, Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of Labor Education Research at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, found aggressive anti-union campaigns at many companies.	B	union
In two-thirds of unionization elections, she found, workers were required to attend one-on-one anti-union meetings with a supervisor at least weekly.	I	union
Bronfenbrenner also said that employers threatened to shut plants in 57% of unionization elections, to reduce wages and benefits in 47% and to discharge workers in 34%.	I	union

The Labor Department on Wednesday released the final version of a rule requiring employers to disclose relationships with the consultants they hire to help persuade workers not to form a union or support a union’s collective bargaining position.	B	Labor Department unveils union 'persuader' rule
The department said the rule, which will be published on Thursday and apply to agreements made after July 1, is necessary because workers are frequently in the dark about who is trying to sway them when they exercise their labor rights.	I	Labor Department unveils union 'persuader' rule
“In many organizing campaigns, decisions that workers make about whether to choose to stand together are often influenced by paid consultants, or persuaders, who are hired by employers to craft the management message being delivered to workers,” Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a call with reporters.	B	persuader
“About 75 percent of employers hire such persuaders, and too often, workers do not know.	I	persuader
”The 1959 law on which the regulations are based already required employers to disclose the hiring of such consultants.	O	O
But the Labor Department argued that previous administrations had allowed an enormous loophole that effectively exempted consultants who coached supervisors on how to influence employees so long as the consultants didn’t interact with the employees directly.	B	persuader
The use of consultants has proliferated since the 1970s, and the techniques they deploy to discourage workers from forming unions have become progressively more sophisticated — more akin to modern political campaigns than workplace discussions.	B	persuader
There are consultants “scripting what managers and supervisors say to workers,” Mr. Perez said.	B	persuader
The new rule will require employers to disclose in government filings any consultant they hire to develop plans or policies for supervisors involved in attempting to persuade workers, who create materials that will be distributed through the workplace for this reason, and who lead seminars on how to discourage workers from forming unions or bargaining collectively.	B	union 'persuader' rule
In addition to disclosing the hiring of a consultant, the employers will have to disclose the fees involved.	I	union 'persuader' rule
The consultants will also have to disclose the relationships and fees in filings of their own.	I	union 'persuader' rule
Opponents of the rule said it was a clear effort by the Labor Department to intervene on behalf of unions.	B	Labor Department unveils union 'persuader' rule
“It is intended to aid organizing by tying one hand behind the back of the employer,” said Marshall Babson, counsel at the law firm Seyfarth Shaw and a former National Labor Relations Board member who works with management on labor issues.	B	Labor Department unveils union 'persuader' rule
Mr.Babson argued that the fee disclosure requirement would discourage law firms from providing advice to clients, much of which, he said, involves discouraging them from making unlawful threats or promises to workers during organizing campaigns, or unlawfully interrogating them.	B	union 'persuader' rule
“It’s something that tends to chill the seeking of legal advice,” he said.	O	O
“How is that in anyone’s interest.	O	O
”But Mr. Perez and his aides said that lawyers would only have to make the relevant disclosures if they provide advice about how to discourage the formation of a union or collective bargaining.	B	persuader
He said that advice on pure legal matters would remain uncovered by the rule.	O	O
Moreover, the specific content of lawyers’ discussions would be protected by attorney-client privilege and not subject to disclosure.	O	O
More broadly, they said, the rule was about restoring a measure of balance between labor and management.	B	union 'persuader' rule
Department officials point out that under the original 1959 law, labor unions must disclose spending related to workplace organizing campaigns.	O	O
Paul Secunda, a professor of labor law at Marquette University Law School who recently proposed that employers who address workers during organizing campaigns be required to give union organizers a similar opportunity, said that the consultants tend to be extremely effective at creating an environment in which many workers fear for their job if they opt to form a union.	B	persuader
Employees should “understand that the employer is not just speaking generically in their best interest,” Mr.Secunda said.	O	O
“They wouldn’t spend so much on persuaders if it wasn’t important to keep unions out of the workplace.”.	B	union

FTC accuses Endo, other drugmakers of antitrust violations
TRENTON, N.J.	O	O
The Federal Trade Commission has accused several drugmakers of violating antitrust laws, via agreements the commission said delayed the U.S. launches of cheaper generic versions of two popular pain treatments.	O	O
It’s the first so-called “pay for delay” case brought by the commission in which a drug’s original maker agreed not to sell its own “authorized generic” version until well after a generic drugmaker began selling its product.	B	drugmakers
That guaranteed the generic drugmaker would have no competition, and so could keep prices high, for at least six months.	I	drugmakers
The FTC alleges Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc., maker of Opana ER pain pills and the Lidoderm pain patch, paid Impax Laboratories Inc. and Watson Laboratories Inc., respectively, to delay selling their approved generic versions.	O	O
Watson is now part of Allergan PLC, which is nominally based in Ireland but has operational headquarters in Parsippany, New Jersey.	B	other drugmakers
Endo, which is based in Dublin and has U.S. headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania, wrote in an email to The Associated Press that “the FTC complaint has no merit” because Endo’s agreements allowed the generic versions to go on sale before expiration of the brand-name drugs’ patents.	B	FTC accuses Endo
Patents guarantee drugmakers the exclusive right to sell their drug for about 10 to 12 years after it is launched.	O	O
Neither Allergan nor Impax, which is based in Hayward, California, responded to Associated Press inquiries.	O	O
According to the FTC complaint, Endo and two partner companies made a reverse payment under a May 2012 agreement with Watson.	B	FTC accuses Endo, other drugmakers of antitrust violations
That’s because the deal barred them from selling an authorized generic version of the Lidoderm patch until months after Watson began selling its generic version.	O	O
FTC chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a statement that such settlements barring authorized generic competition “harm consumers twice — first by delaying the entry of generic drugs and then by preventing additional generic competition in the market following generic entry.	B	antitrust violations
”The FTC complaint alleges that Endo paid Watson “hundreds of millions of dollars” to delay selling generic Lidoderm patches until September 2013, and Endo also agreed not to sell an authorized generic that would compete with Watson’s version for 7 1/2 months.	B	FTC accuses Endo, other drugmakers of antitrust violations
The last patent covering Lidoderm expired in October 2015, according to Endo spokeswoman Heather Zoumas-Lubeski.	O	O
However, Watson had filed a lawsuit challenging the validity of Lidoderm’s patent.	O	O
Such lawsuits are part of the complex rules under which companies wanting to sell a generic version of a brand-name drug seek the right to be the first generic allowed on the market.	O	O
If the generic company wins the lawsuit, it gets the exclusive right to sell its generic for 180 days, usually at a slightly lower price than the brand-name drug — unless it’s competing with an authorized generic from the brand-name company.	B	drugmakers
Because such lawsuits are risky and expensive for both sides, the brand-name drugmaker and the generic challenger often reach a settlement allowing the generic company to sell its version at some point before the drug’s key patent expires.	B	drugmakers
Those agreements generally are legal — unless the brand-name drugmaker makes a payment in return to the generic company.	O	O
After the 180 days, other companies with approved generic versions can begin selling them.	O	O
The increased competition then pushes down prices, eventually as much as 85 percent.	O	O
Meanwhile, Opana ER’s key patent expired in September 2013.	O	O
However, under a 2010 agreement with Endo, Impax began selling its generic version in January 2013.	O	O
According to the FTC, Endo paid Impax more than $112 million, then used the delay until January 2013 to try to switch patients to a new formulation of Opana ER with a longer patent life.	B	Endo
Lidoderm was a blockbuster, with U.S. sales alone approaching $1 billion in 2012, while OPEC ER had U.S. sales exceeding $250 million in 2010, the FTC said.	O	O
Both are pricey.	O	O
A month’s supply of brand-name Lidoderm patches costs about $300, while generic lidocaine patches sell for $160 to $245.	O	O
A month’s worth of 10-milligram Opana ER pills costs about $300, while generic oxymorphone pills cost about $225 to $250.	O	O

Starboard launches proxy fight to remove entire Yahoo board
Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP moved on Thursday to overthrow the entire board of Yahoo Inc YHOO.	O	O
O, including Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, who has struggled to turn around the company in her nearly four years at the helm.	O	O
Starboard, which has been pushing for changes at Yahoo since 2014 and owns about 1.7 percent of the company, said it would nominate nine candidates for the board.	B	 Yahoo board
The proxy fight comes as Yahoo is pressing ahead with an auction of its core Internet business, which includes search, mail and news sites.	O	O
The faded Internet pioneer has been struggling to keep up with Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Facebook Inc (FB.O) in the battle for online advertisers.	O	O
Yahoo said in a statement it will review Starboard’s nominees and respond in due course.	B	Starboard
Yahoo and Starboard could still come to an agreement before the company’s annual meeting, expected to be in late June.	O	O
If they cannot avoid a proxy fight and the Yahoo board election is taken to a shareholder vote, attention will swing to the large mutual and index funds that own the stock and will carry heavy weight in the final tally.	B	proxy fight
“We think everyone getting into the stock over the past six months, and most of those easing their way out, will all side with Starboard,” said Don Bilson, head of event-driven research at Gordon Haskett, an independent research firm.	B	Starboard
BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Vanguard Group, State Street Corp (STT.N) and Fidelity Investments own a combined 16.2 percent of Yahoo shares, according to Thomson Reuters data, with Goldman Sachs owning another 4.2 percent.	O	O
Yahoo co-founder David Filo - one of the board members Starboard wants to remove - is the company’s largest shareholder with a 7.5-percent stake.	O	O
Yahoo and Starboard representatives met on March 10 to discuss ways the two sides could avoid a proxy fight, according to people familiar with the matter [nL2N16C2B1].	B	proxy fight
But those talks broke down, in part because Starboard was upset by Yahoo’s announcement that same day that it appointed two new board directors, these people say.	B	board
“We have been extremely disappointed with Yahoo’s dismal financial performance,” Starboard said in its latest letter to Yahoo, adding that its need to officially launch a proxy fight was “unfortunate.	B	Starboard launches proxy fight
” [nPn8lrD4S]Starboard said it remained open to discussions with Yahoo and was hopeful that it could reach an agreement to get involved with the company.	B	Yahoo
Given that Starboard is proposing nine new directors, a settlement prior to the annual meeting would focus on whether or not Yahoo is willing to give up control of the board.	B	 Yahoo board
Some Yahoo investors are concerned that a proxy fight could hinder the auction effort, since a buyer would want to know if a stable board and management team is in place before putting in an offer, sources have said.	B	proxy fight
[nL2N16C2B1]Starboard said in its letter that one reason for its desire to shake up the board is to ensure that the core business is properly sold, adding that it was concerned with how the process was going so far.	B	Starboard launches proxy fight to remove entire Yahoo board
Slideshow (2 Images)“The same management team and Board that has failed shareholders for years wants shareholders to entrust them with one of the most crucial decisions yet to be made,” Starboard founder Jeffrey Smith wrote in the letter, referring to the auction of the core business.	B	entire Yahoo board
Yahoo’s shares, which have fallen about 22 percent in the past 12 months, were down 0.9 percent at $34.49 in early trading on Thursday.	O	O
They were trading around $40 when Starboard first launched its Yahoo campaign, where the hedge fund advocated for Yahoo to merge with AOL, now owned by Verizon.	O	O
Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).	O	O
Starboard’s nominees include its chief executive, Jeffrey Smith, and Eddy Hartenstein, the former chief executive of Tribune Co; Bridget Baker, NBCUniversal’s former president of TV Networks Distribution; and Rick Hill, the former chairman of Tessera Technologies.	O	O
Hill, who experienced a Starboard attack when he was at Tessera, has served on several of Smith’s director slates since.	O	O
[nL2N16W154]The deadline for shareholders to nominate directors to stand for election at the annual meeting expires on Saturday.	O	O
Starboard has made clear since January that it is seeking the ouster of Mayer and of board directors, though how many board seats Smith sought was a mystery until news of the slate broke late on Wednesday.	B	Starboard launches proxy fight to remove entire Yahoo board
The hedge fund interviewed more than 100 candidates for its director slate, according to a person familiar with the matter.	O	O
A shareholder move to overthrow an entire board is very rare, and even more extraordinary for Starboard given its relatively small ownership of Yahoo’s stock.	B	Starboard launches proxy fight to remove entire Yahoo board
In October 2014, Starboard Value LP won its standoff with Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI.N), convincing shareholders to replace the whole board of the Olive Garden parent.	O	O
Starboard currently owns 5.2 percent of Darden’s stock, and that is after selling a significant amount of shares earlier this month.	O	O

Puerto Rico authorizes debt payment suspension; Obama signs rescue bill
Puerto Rico authorized suspension of payments on its general obligation debt on Thursday just minutes after U.S. President Barack Obama signed a law creating a federal oversight board with authority to negotiate the restructuring of the island’s $70 billion in debt.U.S. President Barack Obama signs into law S. 337: FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 and S. 2328: Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act at the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 30, 2016.	O	O
REUTERS/Carlos BarriaThe executive order issued by Puerto Rico’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, comes just one day before the U.S. territory was due to make $1.9 billion worth of debt payments on July 1, including some $780 million in constitutionally-backed, general obligation bonds.	O	O
It remains to be seen whether Puerto Rico will pay part of the GO debt or any of the non-GO debt.	O	O
“Under these circumstances, these executive orders protect the limited resources available to the agencies listed in these orders and prevents that these can be seized by creditors, leaving Puerto Ricans without basic services,” Garcia Padilla’s administration said in a statement.	O	O
The flurry of activity represents the nadir of a decade-long struggle by Puerto Rico, home to 3.5 million Americans, to stave off economic collapse, reverse a 45 percent poverty rate and stem rampant emigration that exacerbates the economy’s decline.	B	Puerto Rico
Garcia Padilla authorized the suspension of general obligation payments under a previously enacted local debt moratorium law that has already been challenged by a creditor lawsuit filed in U.S.	O	O
District Court in Manhattan.	O	O
In addition, Garcia Padilla also declared states of emergency at the island’s biggest public pension - the Commonwealth’s Employee Retirement System - which is more than 99 percent underfunded, as well as the University of Puerto Rico and other agencies.	O	O
Puerto Rico’s benchmark 2035 General Obligation bond rose 0.44 points in price to trade at 67.19 points, pushing the yield down to 12.578 percent.	O	O

O	O
REUTERS/Carlos Barria“I want to let the people of Puerto Rico know that although there are still some tough work that we’re going to have to do to dig Puerto Rico out of the hole that it’s in, this indicates how committed my administration is to making sure that they get the help they need,” Obama told reporters before signing it.	B	Governor
The law will allow the island access to a bankruptcy-like debt restructuring process, but put its finances under the control of a federally-appointed board — a condition that has riled many in Puerto Rico, including Garcia Padilla.	O	O
PROMESA, which passed the U.S.	O	O
Senate on Wednesday, puts a stay, or halt, on litigation in the event of a default.	O	O
Puerto Rico has already defaulted three times on portions of its debt in the last year.	O	O
The stay is critical to keep Puerto Rico’s financial restructuring from devolving into a mess of long, costly court battles.	O	O
The stay is retroactive back to December 2015.	O	O
The oversight board will have the authority to facilitate consensual restructuring talks, or push Puerto Rico into a court-supervised process akin to U.S. bankruptcy.	O	O
It will also oversee and monitor the implementation of sustainable budgets.	O	O
Still, missed payments matter for the insurers who have to pay out on claims should Puerto Rico not deliver the cash to its investors.	O	O
MBIA’s National Public Finance Guarantee insures about $173 million in GO debt due on Friday, while Assured Guaranty covers another $184 million, and Ambac insures $40 million in GO or GO-guaranteed debt due on Friday.	O	O
The island’s debt-laden semi-public power utility, PREPA, earlier on Thursday announced it will make its full, $415 million payment due Friday, under the terms of a restructuring agreement reached late last year with the bulk of its creditors.	O	O
PREPA, which had been on the brink of collapse under $8.3 billion in debt, last year reached an exchange deal with most of its creditors, which is being finalized.	O	O
The payment will be made using operational funds and proceeds from new bond sales.	O	O
“Today’s outcome is another step towards PREPA’s transformation,” Lisa Donahue, the utility’s chief restructuring officer, said in a statement.	O	O

However, creditors have filed lawsuits in the U.S. courts, calling the measure illegal as Puerto Rico, and its debt, is subject to U.S. statutes rather than local law.	B	Puerto Rico Governor suspends payments on infrastructure debt

Earlier this month, the U.S.House of Representatives passed legislation aimed at creating a federal oversight board to oversee a restructuring of the island’s debt, while putting in place a suspension on any past and future lawsuits related to the non-payment of some of its debts.	O	O
The U.S.Senate is slated to vote on the measure before Puerto Rico is scheduled to make July 1 debt payments of nearly $2 billion.	O	O

Turkey opened one of the world's largest bridges Friday designed to allow traffic to cross the Bosphorus Strait between Europe and Asia and ease congestion in Istanbul.	O	O
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan oversaw a ceremony inaugurating the $3 billion Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, which is touted by its Turko-Italian developers as the world's broadest suspension bridge at 58.4 meters (192 feet) wide.	O	O
The toll bridge, spanning 1,408 meters (4,620 feet) over the Bosphorus, features 10 lanes, including two rail lines.	O	O
At 322 meters (1,056 feet), officials say the bridge's 322-meter (1,056-foot) towers are also the tallest in the world.	O	O

International movies will be filmed here, you will see," Erdogan told the audience, among them the king of Bahrain, dignitaries from several other countries and hundreds of citizens.	O	O
Some vehicles were permitted to cross the bridge for the first time Friday, while the general public can start using it Saturday, Erdogan said.	O	O
Located near the Black Sea coast north of Istanbul, the bridge is expected to ease traffic gridlock in the city of 15 million, in part because heavy trucks will be required to use it rather than the two older bridges nearer the city.	B	3rd Istanbul bridge linking Europe with Asia
Not everybody likes the bridge's name.	B	3rd Istanbul bridge linking Europe with Asia

Turkey has opened a massive $3-billion suspension bridge that links the European and Asian sides of Istanbul.	O	O
The relative of the Golden Gate, Akashi Kaikyo, and Moscow’s Crimean Bridge was unveiled by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday.	O	O
The 1.4 kilometer- (0.9 mile-) long, 59 meter (65 yard-) wide Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge was opened at a ceremony attended both by Erdogan and Prime Minister Binali Yildirim while a massive crowd waved Turkish flags.	O	O
The ambitious project has been seen by many as Erdogan’s attempt to leave his mark on the country’s history – including by the Turkish president himself.	B	Turkey unveils 3rd Istanbul bridge linking Europe with Asia
“When a man dies, he leaves behind a monument,” Erdogan said during the ceremony.	I	Turkey unveils 3rd Istanbul bridge linking Europe with Asia
The style of the bridge, which is named after a 16th-century Ottoman ruler, resembles that of Istanbul’s existing bridges, as well as that of the iconic Manhattan Bridge.	O	O
However, the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge constructed by Italy’s Astaldi and Istanbul-based IC Ictas was built to be the tallest and broadest suspension bridge in the world.	O	O
The bridge will ease traffic in the region, where around 135,000 vehicles are projected to cross the bridge each day.	O	O
The project is part of Erdogan’s $200 billion infrastructure plan that was announced three years ago and is planned to continue for over a decade.	O	O
Bridges have taken on a more symbolic role in Turkey in the aftermath of the failed July coup attempt.	O	O
The violent and bloody clashes between pro-coup troops and anti-coup protesters on Istanbul’s Bosphorus Bridge led it to be renamed the Martyrs of July 15 Bridge.	O	O

Goldman Sachs launches GS Bank, an Internet bank with a $1 minimum deposit
Goldman Sachs  has traditionally functioned like a run-of-the-mill investment bank.	B	Goldman Sachs
Minimums to open an account were in the range of $10 million, and returns were not guaranteed.	O	O
While that will still remain true for the firm’s wealth management arm, Goldman is opening its doors to the masses with the launch of GS Bank, an FDIC-insured, Internet-based savings bank.	B	Goldman Sachs launches GS Bank
And just what do we mean by the masses.	O	O
Well, anyone with an Internet connection and a dollar — because that is what each account’s minimum balance will be.	O	O
GS Bank’s interest rates will be high, giving customers an annual yield of 1.05 percent.	O	O
This rate trumps the average U.S. saving’s bank yield of .06 percent APY, but is relatively in line with other online rival banks like Ally, which offers 1 percent APY.	O	O
Deposit yields from online banks are traditionally much higher than traditional banks, mainly because of the cost savings that come from not having to support brick-and-mortar branches.	O	O
The bank was born out of Goldman’s acquisition of GE Capital Bank, the online retail bank previously run by General Electric’s capital arm.	O	O
The launch of GS Bank and acquisition of GE Capital Bank is a move by Goldman to diversify revenue streams and strengthen liquidity in a market where traditional investment banking isn’t doing as well as it has in the past.	B	Goldman Sachs launches GS Bank
Currently, GS Bank has total deposits of around $114 billion, which pales in comparison to the total deposits of large consumer banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America.	O	O

But online-only accounts eliminate the costs of running brick-and-mortar branches, which allows banks to offer better rates.	O	O

The price of Brent crude initially jumped by 5% but then fell to to stand 1.6% higher at $47.56 a barrel.	O	O
A statement said the plan was to support the "stability of the oil market ensuring a stable level of investment in the long term".	B	Russian and Saudi plans
At the start of 2016 the price of oil fell to its lowest level in nearly 13 years due to a production glut and is still far below the $110 a barrel price hit just two years ago.	O	O
Mr Novak said the agreement, which might include attempts to limit oil output, was a "historical moment" between members of Opec, the oil producers' cartel, and non-members such as Russia.	B	Russian and Saudi plans
He added that Russia was willing to join an oil output "freeze".'Getting better'The outline agreement, to set up a joint task force, was announced at a news conference at the G20 summit in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou.	O	O
However, Saudi Arabia's Mr al-Falih said that freezing output was not "necessary" now.	O	O

Apple and Samsung have been battling over mobile device technology patents for years.	O	O
Apple has mostly prevailed, and in December, Samsung paid Apple $548.2 million stemming from a separate patent case, which Samsung has appealed to the U.S.	O	O
Supreme Court.	O	O
Friday’s ruling was issued by a unanimous three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, the country’s top court specializing in patent issues.	O	O
The ruling reverses a May 2014 verdict from a federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using Apple’s patented technology without permission.	O	O
Infringement of the quick links feature, which allows the device to recognise data on the touchscreen, such as a phone number, and link to it to make a call, accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages.	O	O
While the appeals court said that Samsung did not use the same technology to detect and link to specific data, it also said Apple’s other patents were obvious compared to previously known inventions and should never have been granted.	B	patent
Chicago-based patent lawyer Bradley Hulbert, who has followed the litigation, said the decision is “a clear signal that Apple is not invincible and that alternative operating systems are here to stay.	B	Samsung wins appeal in patent dispute with Apple

A three-judge panel of the U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed a 2014 verdict by a jury that had been seen as a small victory for Apple.	O	O
The Cupertino, Calif., company had initially sought more than $2 billion in damages from Samsung for infringing on eight software patents.	O	O
The jury found that Samsung had infringed on three Apple patents.	O	O
But Friday, the appeals court said two of those patents should not have been granted, and it added that Samsung didn’t infringe on the third.	B	Samsung

“Today’s decision proves that we did not infringe on any of Apple’s patents,” the spokeswoman said, calling it “a win for consumer choice.	I	Samsung wins appeal in patent dispute with Apple
”Apple could appeal to the U.S.Supreme Court, but legal experts doubted the high court would take the case, in part because it doesn’t pose new or novel legal questions.	O	O
Rutgers University law professor Michael Carrier said the case is “much too far in the weeds for the Supreme Court.	B	appeal in patent dispute with Apple
”The case had few commercial implications after a judge declined to issue an injunction barring Samsung from selling some phones, reducing the dispute to money.	O	O
Moreover, the two companies agreed to drop all litigation outside the U.S. last year.	O	O
Friday’s ruling likely ends one of two major trials of the so-called patent wars between Apple and Samsung over the design and functionality of their smartphones.	O	O
Apple sued Samsung twice, in 2011 and 2012, claiming the Korean handset maker copied some design and software features of iPhones.	O	O
Apple initially sought more than $4.5 billion in the two cases combined.	O	O
In the first case, a federal jury in San Jose, Calif., ruled in 2012 that Samsung infringed on six Apple patents, including some that focused on design elements such as the iPhone’s rounded corners and app icons.	O	O
Samsung has agreed to pay Apple $548 million in that case, and the two sides are set to soon argue to a judge regarding another potential roughly $380 million in damages.	O	O
Samsung has appealed the case to the Supreme Court.	O	O
Friday’s ruling involved the second case, centering on patents for certain software features, including slide-to-unlock and autocorrect.	B	Samsung wins appeal in patent dispute with Apple
The judges ruled that Apple patents on those two features were invalid because similar ideas had been floating around the tech industry when Apple applied for the patents.	B	Apple
The judges said “both patents were obvious because there was stuff in the field already,” Mr.Carrier said.	B	patent
The judges also overturned a ruling that Samsung infringed on an Apple patent for software that automatically converts certain text to links, like a phone number.	O	O
The judges upheld the jury’s ruling that Apple infringed on a Samsung patent for compressing and organizing digital photos and videos.	O	O
That infringement is set to cost Apple $158,400, the only money now changing hands between the companies in the case.	O	O
“This shows the smartphone patent wars might not have been worth it,” Mr. Carrier said.—Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed to this article.	O	O

TransAsia raided, 12 questioned
AIRLINE PROBED:One of those summoned for questioning was a major TransAsia shareholder surnamed Liu, who allegedly sold a large stake in the firm on MondayProsecutors yesterday raided the offices of TransAsia Airways (復興航空) in Taipei as part of a judicial investigation into alleged financial irregularities and fraud.	O	O
Two principal figures, TransAsia chairman Vincent Lin (林明昇), 43, who was listed as a defendant in the case, and his father, Lin Shiaw-shinn (林孝信), 72, were taken to the Taipei District Prosecutors’ Office for questioning.	O	O
Prosecutors questioned a total of 12 people associated with TransAsia and its parent company, SIGMU Group, to gather information and clarify their roles in the events leading up to the announcement on Tuesday that the airline would be dissolved.	O	O
“The 12 people taken in for questioning have been listed as witnesses and we are looking into allegations of possible fraud, insider trading, market manipulation, violation of financial regulations and breaches of the Securities and Exchange Act (證券交易法),” Taipei Deputy Chief Prosecutor Chang Chieh-chin (張介欽) said.	O	O
Much of the focus was on Vincent Lin and his father, SIGMU Group chairman Lin Shiaw-shinn, who also heads private security firm Taiwan Secom (中興保全) and Goldsun Development and Construction Co (國產實業).	O	O
Prosecutors later yesterday confirmed that Vincent Lin had been listed as a defendant.	O	O
During the investigation, prosecutors reportedly uncovered unusual trading activity in TransAsia shares on Monday, a day before Vincent Lin announced the decision to dissolve the airline.	O	O
Among the people summoned for questioning was a major shareholder in TransAsia surnamed Liu (劉), a proprietor of a leading travel agency, who allegedly sold a large number of shares on Monday.	O	O
Prosecutors were still questioning the witnesses at press time last night.	O	O
In related developments, Deputy Minister of Transportation and Communications Wang Kuo-tsai (王國材) yesterday said that China Airlines’ (中華航空) takeover of TransAsia’s domestic routes would continue until Feb. 15.	O	O
Wang’s comments echoed those of Executive Yuan spokesman Hsu Kuo-yung (徐國勇), who said a day earlier that China Airlines’ takeover of the routes on Thursday next week would only be a short-term measure.	O	O
On Wednesday, the Executive Yuan asked China Airlines and its subsidiary, Mandarin Airlines, to take over the domestic routes served by TransAsia.	O	O
Wang said that the Civil Aeronautics Administration would reallocate TransAsia’s air traffic rights and routes by assessing the capacity and safety records of the carriers that express an interest.	O	O
Wang said the redistribution of the routes would be completed by Feb. 15 so that passengers flying to destinations previously served by TransAsia could be catered for “without any disruption.	O	O
”In addition to six domestic routes, TransAsia also flew to 13 Chinese destinations, including Shanghai, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Chongqing, Wuhan, Wuxi and Changsha.	O	O
The airline also flew eight other overseas routes, including Sapporo and Osaka in Japan, Macau, Chiang Mai in Thailand and Jeju, South Korea.	O	O
Taipei to Shanghai has been called a “golden route,” as it commands a higher load factor due to the large number of business travelers.	O	O

Agency data showed that the company owns 11 aircraft and leases 16.	O	O
TransAsia, which is attempting to liquidate its assets to generate funds to cover various expenses, must gain approval for its plan to dispose of its fleet before any sales, the agency said, adding that no airports would allow flights of the airline’s planes.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia
TransAsia’s fleet is comprised of Airbus A320, A321 and A330 aircraft, as well as ATRs, the agency said, adding that the airline had taken delivery of a new Airbus A330 on Saturday.	O	O
Meanwhile, EVA Air (長榮航空) and China Airlines Ltd (中華航空) have agreed to hire some of TransAsia’s pilots, who are to be laid off after it dissolved its business on Tuesday, the agency said.	O	O
TransAsia employed about 170 pilots, including those still in training, 90 of whom are trained to operate A320 and A321 aircraft, the agency said.	O	O
EVA was the first airline to express interest in hiring TransAsia pilots, as it also operates the A321 and ATR, the agency said, adding that EVA Air is facing a pilot shortage.	O	O
However, neither EVA Air nor China Airlines would say how many TransAsia pilots they would hire, as the pilots would have to pass a number of tests and certifications before being accepted, it added.	O	O
The Taoyuan Union of Pilots said that it would assist the TransAsia pilots in finding employment opportunities, urging other local airlines to hire some of them so that they can remain in Taiwan.	O	O
“It is not easy to train pilots.	O	O
Airlines worldwide are short of workers, resulting in employees working overtime and being unable to take holidays as they normally would,” the union said.	O	O
“We hope that Taiwanese airlines can move quickly to hire these pilots, so that they can continue working in Taiwan,” it added.	B	Taiwanese airline
“Otherwise, some of the high-quality pilots would be recruited by foreign airlines, which would force the nation’s airlines to look overseas for qualified workers.”.	O	O

TransAsia creditors urge restructuring
MOUNTAINS OF DEBT:Local banks have exposure to the airline through numerous loans and convertible bonds maturing next week, which it said could not be claimedTransAsia Airways Corp’s (復興航空) creditor banks yesterday expressed their hope that the 65-year-old airline would restructure its finances instead of dissolving the company.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia shuts down after heavy losses
Financial Supervisory Commission data showed that domestic banks have NT$11.06 billion (US$346.93 million) in exposure from TransAsia, which on Tuesday announced plans to dissolve its operations to curb losses.	O	O
State-run Taiwan Cooperative Bank (TCB, 合庫銀行), lead bank of a syndicated loan to the airline, said restructuring would be a more favorable option, as lenders would not need to find buyers for collateral assets.	O	O
TransAsia owes TCB and other banks NT$4 billion from a 2011 syndicated loan of NT$5.5 billion to acquire two aircraft, TCB spokesman Davis Hu (胡光華) said.	O	O
“I am afraid there is little else we can do other than foreclose on the airplanes if TransAsia insists on bowing out and defaults on its debt,” Hsu said by telephone after a meeting of creditor banks.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia
TCB contributed NT$1.6 billion to the syndicated loan and lent a further NT$400 million for a separate aircraft purchase, Hu said.	O	O
TCB, the nation’s largest lender by outlets, would have to raise provisions for loans to TransAsia, which could dampen earnings, despite holding sufficient collateral, Hu said, adding that creditor banks have been left to watch the drama unfold.	O	O
Mega International Commercial Bank (兆豐銀行), another state-run lender, unequivocally said that it prefers restructuring to dissolution and would convey that message in separate discussions with TransAsia.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia shuts down after heavy losses
TransAsia had owed NT$1.7 billion to Mega Bank, which reduced the amount to NT$1.59 billion by confiscating the airline’s deposits, said a Mega Bank official said by telephone, who spoke on condition of anonymity.	O	O
“The best-case scenario would be for TransAsia to find a buyer and inject new capital,” the official said, adding that consolidation would not be impossible, as other domestic airlines are interested in routes TransAsia operated.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia
Mega Bank is to incur US$16 million in impaired asset losses for acquiring convertible bonds issued by TransAsia in 2013, which the airline has said the lender would be unable to redeem on their maturity on Tuesday next week.	O	O
“The chance for recovery [of the bond investment] is slim, due to the absence of collateral,” the official said.	O	O
Mega Bank said that it would hold talks with the airline on its debt today.	O	O
In 2013, TransAsia issued US$75 million in convertible bonds in a bid to shore up its finances.	O	O

TransAsia Airways employees protest at ministry
More than 200 TransAsia Airways employees yesterday protested outside the Ministry of Labor in Taipei, demanding that the ministry intervene to compel the firm to negotiate directly with a newly formed union over redundancy terms.	O	O
The protest follows the unexpected announcement by the company on Tuesday that it is to be dissolved, with the airline promptly shutting down operations.	O	O
Union deputy executive director Pang Min-yi (龐閔憶) blasted the management team for refusing to recognize the newly formed union as a legitimate partner for conducting negotiations.	O	O
“We need the help of a third party to ensure that negotiations are completed swiftly,” he said.	O	O
Protesters also demanded that the company be forbidden from arbitrarily laying off workers if it manages to avoid dissolution and called for revisions to the Mass Labor Layoff Protection Act (大量解僱勞工保護法) to explicitly mandate that companies negotiate with unions rather than individual employees about redundancy packages.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia
The firm’s dissolution could put more than 1,700 employees out of work, many of whom have joined the company union, which was formed after the announcement on Tuesday.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia shuts down after heavy losses
Union representatives demanded that each employee be given NT$500,000 (US$15,661) on top of their regular severance pay and that the company continue to pay wages until Jan. 21 because of its obligation to provide employees with 60 days’ notice.	O	O
Lo Wen-chuan (羅文娟), an official at the Ministry of Labor, said that the ministry would work with the Taipei City Government to ensure that the negotiations be held as soon as possible.	O	O
Separately yesterday, more than half of TransAsia’s pilots joined an information session hosted by EVA Airways.	O	O
Civil Aeronautics Administration data showed that TransAsia has about 170 pilots, including those who are in training.	O	O
EVA and China Airlines have agreed to recruit some of the pilots if they pass the required tests and certifications.	O	O
A pilot surnamed Yang (楊) said he had already retired from TransAsia after working for the company for 20 years, but was asked to come back after its business suffered following two plane crashes in 2014 and last year.	O	O
He said he had resumed work for less than a year when the company announced that it was shutting down.	O	O
Yang said he has mixed feelings about the company’s decision, but chose to attend the information session as part of his right as a laid-off worker.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia shuts down after heavy losses
Another pilot who requested anonymity said he used to work in the semiconductor sector, but spent about NT$2 million to attend a pilot school abroad to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.	O	O
He joined TransAsia 10 months ago and was scheduled to begin flying next month.	O	O
He said he is concerned about whether EVA would recruit him.	O	O
He is over 35 years old and has a family to support.	O	O
EVA Pilot Union founder Lin Shao-ming (林邵民) said that EVA has stipulated that it would accept pilots who have accumulated more than 2,000 flight hours.	O	O
However, these pilots would first be employed as copilots and can only qualify for promotion after accumulating 3,600 flight hours.	O	O
They must undergo six to eight months of training in the initial stage, he said.	O	O
While almost all of TransAsia’s pilots have accumulated more than 2,000 flight hours, only about 20 of its copilots meet the minimum requirement that EVA has set, Lin said, adding that a majority of the copilots have less than 1,000 flight hours.	O	O
As EVA is short of pilots following a fleet expansion, Lin said that he does not oppose the company’s decision to recruit pilots from TransAsia.	O	O
However, EVA must not forget that 30 to 40 of its copilots are waiting to be promoted to pilots, he added.	O	O
China Airlines is scheduled to hold an information session for pilots today at TransAsia’s headquarters in Taipei.	O	O

Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Culture and Communications Committee deputy director Hung Meng-kai speaks at a news conference in Taipei yesterday.
‘ECONOMICALLY VICTIMIZED’:One KMT official said the president has hung the private sector out to dry by not recognizing the effects of a decline in Chinese touristsChinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Culture and Communications Committee deputy director Hung Meng-kai speaks at a news conference in Taipei yesterday.	O	O
The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) yesterday blamed the government for TransAsia Airways’ demise, saying President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) cross-strait policy and a decline in the number of Chinese tourists were responsible for the airline’s dissolution.	O	O
Although TransAsia “admittedly has internal problems,” the losses incurred by the declining number of Chinese tourists that occurred under the Tsai administration made TransAsia vulnerable, as cross-strait travel comprised 40 percent of the airline’s operations, KMT Culture and Communications Committee deputy director Tang Te-ming (唐德明) said at a news conference.	O	O
TransAsia, an ailing company founded in 1951, is estimated to have paid nearly NT$1.2 billion (US$37.6 million) in compensation to victims and their families of two deadly crashes in July 2014 and February last year.	O	O
“The Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] government’s policies have led to a cooling of cross-strait relations, which affected cross-strait flights.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia
Those issues were probably the last straw for TransAsia,” Tang said, citing a recent poll that showed Tsai’s disapproval rating has climbed to nearly 60 percent and identified her cross-strait policy as causing the “suffering of the public.	I	Taiwanese airline TransAsia
”The number of Chinese tourists showed annual declines of 15 percentage points in July, 33 percentage points in August and 38 percentage points in September, KMT Culture and Communications Committee deputy director Hung Meng-kai (洪孟楷) said.	O	O
Statistics have shown that the average Chinese tourist spends about US$295 on goods and services during their stay in Taiwan, with the decline of 100,000 Chinese tourists in September causing a loss of NT$900 million for the nation’s tourism industry, Hung said, adding that at this rate, “losses for the year will total NT$12 billion.	O	O
”The Tsai administration has “economically victimized” the private sector, Hung said, adding: “Tsai should accept the fact that the number of Chinese tourists has dropped by a significant amount and stop leading the nation with ideology.	O	O
”Beijing has imposed a series of punitive measures against the DPP government over its refusal to acknowledge the so-called “1992 consensus,” such as suspending official cross-strait communication mechanisms and reducing the number of Chinese tourists allowed to visit Taiwan.	O	O
The “1992 consensus” refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge that there is “one China,” with each side having its own interpretation of what “China” means.	O	O
Former Mainland Affairs Council chairman Su Chi (蘇起) in 2006 admitted to making up the term in 2000.	O	O
TransAsia had more passengers in the first three quarters of this year than it did last year and in 2014, suggesting that Chinese tourists had “little effect” on its business, DPP Legislator Wang Ding-yu (王定宇) said.	O	O
“TransAsia’s sudden suspension of flights and ensuing dissolution should be seen as a reflection of its flight safety practices, corporate mismanagement and the allocation of its funds.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia shuts down after heavy losses
It is not a situation that can be attributed to a single factor,” Wang said.	I	Taiwanese airline TransAsia shuts down after heavy losses
“The KMT has not conducted any research to back up its claims that the fall in the number of Chinese tourists and the Tsai administration are to blame,” he said.	O	O
“It is not a political party accustomed to using its brain.”.	O	O

TransAsia Airways Corp (復興航空) yesterday said it is to dissolve the company after its attempts to keep it afloat failed.	O	O
The company looked at options, including a sale, restructuring and capital injections, during three meetings between its board of directors and industry experts, TransAsia Airways chief executive officer Liu Tung-ming (劉東明) told a news conference at the Taiwan Stock Exchange.	O	O
“Despite our best efforts to devise a new business model, the company could not produce an effective turnaround plan to repair its deteriorating finances,” Liu said.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia
The airline said it is unable to repay US$75 million in European convertible bonds due on Tuesday next week.	O	O
The company’s net worth was estimated at about NT$5.44 billion (US$170.29 million), or a book value of NT$7.17 per share, as of the end of last month, TransAsia vice president Chen I-chieh (陳逸潔) said.	O	O
The airline operated 27 routes in Taiwan, China and the rest of Asia, each representing about a third of total sales, Chen said.	O	O
In the first three quarters, the company racked up losses of NT$2.2 billion, Liu said.	O	O
TransAsia chairman Vincent Lin (林明昇) blamed the declining number of Chinese visitors, as well as rising fuel prices and a strengthening US dollar, for the company’s steep losses.	B	heavy losses
TransAsia’s load factor had fallen to about 60 percent, which was well below its domestic peers’ and unsustainable, Lin said.	O	O
TransAsia shares are to resume trading today following yesterday’s suspension, but trading would be conducted on a full-cash delivery basis, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said.	O	O
At a news conference held jointly with the heads of government agencies yesterday, the Cabinet said that the impact of the airline’s closure would be limited and the company has enough cash to refund customers and cover severance pay.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia shuts down after heavy losses
An estimated 100,000 travelers are affected by the unexpected folding of the nation’s first commercial airline, but other carriers have capacity to take on passengers booked to fly with TransAsia as it is the off-season, Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Air Transport Division director Han Chen-hua (韓振華) said.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia shuts down after heavy losses
TransAsia has created a trust fund to ensure that customers get a full refund on booked flights, and the company will not dismiss ticketing and customer service staff until Dec. 20, so that they can assist in the transfer of passengers to other airlines, the firm said.	O	O
The CAA formed a special task force immediately after TransAsia announced a temporary suspension of operations on Monday to ensure that travelers’ rights are protected, Fan said.	O	O
The CAA is to impose a fine of between NT$600,000 and NT$3 million on TransAsia for halting flights without seeking prior approval.	O	O
The CAA has conducted regular financial inspections on TransAsia, and the company still holds more than NT$1 billion in cash and is not facing an immediate financial crisis, Han said.	O	O
TransAsia has 1,735 employees and they are covered by labor insurance, while there is NT$310 million in the company’s pension fund account, Deputy Minister of Labor Kuo Kuo-wen (郭國文) said.	O	O
“The money is more than enough to pay employees’ pensions and the remaining amount can be used to cover severance pay,” Kuo said.	O	O
The FSC and prosecutors have launched an inspection into possible insider trading in the company’s shares, and it has yet to be determined whether company executives were involved, commission vice chairman Huang Tien-mu (黃天牧) said.	O	O
COMPANY CRASHES:The firm’s chairman blamed the declining number of Chinese visitors, rising fuel prices and a strengthening US dollar for its steep lossesThe Taiwan Stock Exchange on Aug. 15 listed TransAsia as financially unstable, to warn investors of the risk involved in trading the company’s shares, Huang said.

A TransAsia Airways passenger aircraft is grounded at Taipei International Airport (Songshan airport) on Tuesday.
TEN AIRCRAFT:As the airline tries to claw back a down payment, its shares are plummeting, with orders to sell 81.75 million TransAsia shares still on the books on FridayA TransAsia Airways passenger aircraft is grounded at Taipei International Airport (Songshan airport) on Tuesday.	O	O
TransAsia Airways Corp (復興航空) is negotiating with Airbus Group SE over the possibility of recovering NT$1.2 billion (US$37.57 million) it has made in down payments for 10 new aircraft, the carrier said yesterday.	O	O
TransAsia made the statement in response to speculation by some aviation industry insiders that as the company has announced its dissolution, it will lose the down payments for the new aircraft, which they estimated at NT$5 billion.	O	O
TransAsia placed orders for six A321neo aircraft in 2010 and four A330-800neo aircraft in 2014.	O	O
They were scheduled to be delivered starting in 2018.	O	O
The two models are officially priced at more than US$70 million and US$250 million respectively.	O	O
According to the insiders, in an aircraft purchase deal, the manufacturer usually gives a discount to the buyer, but requires a large down payment equal to about one-third of the purchase price, which is usually kept secret.	O	O
In TransAsia’s case, the A330-800neos could have been bought at a discounted price of about US$100 million each, while the A321neos might have been sold at a discount of more than 50 percent, they said.	O	O
Based on this estimate, the down payments for the 10 aircraft would amount to NT$5 billion, they said.	O	O
However, TransAsia said that it had made a down payment of only NT$1.2 billion and that it was negotiating with Airbus in the hopes of getting the money back.	O	O
TransAsia on Tuesday announced that it would dissolve due to heavy losses, with all flight services terminated, effective immediately.	B	Taiwanese airline TransAsia shuts down after heavy losses
The airline posted a net loss of NT$2.22 billion and a loss per share of NT$3.42 in the first nine months of this year, with a gross margin of minus-18.76 percent.	O	O
TransAsia has a fleet of 27 aircraft, including 16 leased airplanes and 11 that it owns.	O	O
While the leased aircraft are to go back to their leasing companies, the purchased airplanes are to be sold to repay debts.	O	O
TransAsia shares fell for the third consecutive session on Friday to close at NT$3.80 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE).	O	O
Analysts said there is no sign of the plunge ending soon, with orders to sell 81.75 million TransAsia shares still on the books after the market closed on Friday.	O	O
The airline is scheduled to hold a special general meeting on Jan. 11 for shareholders to vote on the closure decision, which would set the stage for a delisting from the market, the TWSE said.	O	O
Should that happen, a delisting is likely at the end of March after the airline completes all the necessary administrative steps.	O	O

Construction work on a new US airbase in Japan’s southern island of Okinawa is to be suspended, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday.	O	O

"The government has decided to accept the court-mediated settlement plan," Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said, according to the Kyodo news agency.	O	O

Prime Minister Abe still believes the only option is to build the airbase in Henko, which is a sparsely populated coastal area in the north of Okinawa.	B	work on U.S. base on Okinawa
However, he says the government will halt construction work and will try to reach a mutually acceptable solution with the Okinawan authorities.	O	O
Abe’s announcement to suspend the construction of the airbase came after the head of the US Marine Corps said the project to move the airbase from Futenma, which is in a built-up residential area, to Henko, was merely behind schedule.	B	work on U.S. base on Okinawa
General Robert Neller told Congress on Wednesday the project had been “delayed partly due to demonstrators and lack of support from the government of Okinawa,” the Japan Times reported.	B	work on U.S. base on Okinawa

Japan’s Defense Ministry had ordered work on the reclamation project to restart in October, after Governor Onaga revoked permission for the construction.	O	O
However, this has led to mass protests across the country.	B	work on U.S. base on Okinawa
In February, thousands of demonstrators encircled Japan`s parliament in Tokyo to protest against the relocation.	O	O
Over 28,000 people joined the rally, according to the Kyodo news agency.	O	O
Opposition rallies were also held in the cities of Toyama, Okayama, Sapporo, Nagoya and Osaka.	O	O
“The central government is trying to force through landfill work to move the base to Henoko, but justice and righteousness are on our side,” Nago Mayor Susume Inamine said at the rally in Tokyo, according to the Japan Times.	B	work on U.S. base on Okinawa
The previous Okinawa governor, Hirokazu Nakaima, gave the green light for the relocation of the base in 2013.	O	O
However, after Onaga won the elections in 2014, he promised to oppose the plan – to the delight of the majority of locals.	O	O
There has been tension for years between the local population and US servicemen.	O	O
This dates back to a notorious crime committed in 1995, when three US marines kidnapped and raped a 12-year-old schoolgirl.	O	O
There have also been less-publicized sex crime cases involving underage victims reported in 2001 and 2005, the fatal running over of a female high school student by a drunken US marine in 1998, and other incidents.	O	O

The court in February made the proposal as an interim step allowing talks.	O	O

(Kazuhiko Yamashita/AP)TOKYO — In a surprise move, Japan’s prime minister agreed Friday to suspend construction work at a planned U.S. Marine air station on Okinawa, where opponents have battled to block the project.	B	work on U.S. base on Okinawa
The decision was an about-face for the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who had vowed to continue landfill work at the site while legal battles played out.	O	O
But there appeared to be no change in his long-range policy to relocate the air base within Okinawa.	O	O
Instead, Abe agreed to an out-of-court settlement on three lawsuits challenging the relocation of the U.S.	O	O
Marine air station at Futenma, in the most crowded part of Okinawa, to Henoko, a remote, relatively unpopulated part of the main island.	O	O
As part of the deal, proposed by the courts, Abe agreed to suspend reclamation work at Henoko needed to build two runways that would jut into the sea.	O	O
“I have decided to accept the court’s mediation recommendation and settle with the Okinawa prefectural government,” Abe told reporters.	O	O
But any celebrations by opponents may be premature.	O	O
Abe’s move was an attempt to find a way out of the current legal mire, and the prime minister said he remained committed to the goal of relocating the air station.	O	O
“There is no change in the central government’s thinking that relocating the base to Henoko is the only alternative” to Futenma, Abe said.	B	work on U.S. base on Okinawa
“If the current series of lawsuits continues endlessly, we will remain deadlocked and the Futenma base could remain there for years.	I	work on U.S. base on Okinawa
”The central government in Tokyo and authorities in Okinawa have been at loggerheads for 16 months since the southern island chain elected Gov.	O	O
Takeshi Onaga, who vowed to stop the construction of the new air station.	O	O
Many Okinawans want the air station at Futenma closed and moved out of the prefecture rather than to the Henoko site.	O	O
The small island chain bears too much of the burden of Japan’s security alliance with the United States, including all the noise, environmental damage and crime that comes with the bases, they say.	B	U.S. base
Groups of protesters demonstrate every day at the construction site, on an existing U.S. military base at Henoko, while the governor has overturned reclamation permits and used multiple bureaucratic opportunities to stall construction.	O	O

Hezbollah supporters listening to a speech by leader Hassan Nasrallah. The Gulf Cooperation Council said on Wednesday it had designated the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah movement a terrorist group.
The Saudi-dominated bloc of Persian Gulf countries announced Wednesday it was designating Hezbollah a terrorist organization, adding fuel to the confrontation between the region’s Sunni Muslim monarchies and the Lebanese Shiite movement’s main ally—Iran.	B	Lebanon's Hezbollah
The declaration by the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council comes two weeks after Saudi Arabia canceled a $4 billion aid package for Lebanon’s security forces and a week after five members of the bloc warned their citizens against traveling to the heavily tourism-dependent Mediterranean country.

Together with Russian and Iranian forces, Hezbollah militias have played a crucial role in bolstering the embattled Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad against an array of rebel groups, some of whom are supported by Saudi Arabia.	O	O
In a statement Wednesday, the head of the GCC, Abdullatif al-Zayani, said Hezbollah wasn't only engaged in unspecified “hostile acts” in Syria but in Yemen and Iraq, too.	B	Lebanon's Hezbollah
He said the actions posed a threat to “Arab national security” and included arms smuggling, inciting violence and recruiting terrorists.	O	O
On Tuesday, the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, accused Saudi Arabia of orchestrating car bombs in Lebanon and fomenting instability in the country for the sake of weakening the movement.	O	O
“[Saudi’s] problem is with Hezbollah,” Mr. Nasrallah said in a televised speech.	O	O
“They want the government, political powers, and Lebanese people inside and outside Lebanon to stand in the face of Hezbollah so that it abandons its stance from Saudi, even if that requires incitements, civil war or toppling the government.	O	O
”Last weekend, Hezbollah supporters blocked roads around the country to protest what they said was an unflattering depiction of Mr. Nasrallah on the Saudi-owned MBC-TV.	O	O
Lebanon’s politics hew closely to sectarian lines, including a Sunni faction led by the former prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, that is supported by Riyadh.	O	O
Meanwhile, in addition to boasting large military force it deploys abroad, Hezbollah represents Lebanon’s significant Shiite minority and enjoys considerable clout in the Lebanese government and politics.	B	Lebanon's Hezbollah
These divisions have been inflamed by the war next door in Syria, which has sent some 1.1 million Syrians fleeing into Lebanon.	O	O
They have also been compounded by the continued deadlock over who should be the country’s president.	O	O
Parliament has met 36 times over the course of two years without being able who should get the job.	O	O
The GCC issued no further sanctions against Hezbollah or Lebanon on Wednesday, and it wasn’t clear what practical impact its latest declaration would have.	O	O
In Gulf nations, where Hezbollah is already widely viewed as a terrorist organization, there are tough laws stipulating harsh punishments for anyone found to have communicated with a terrorist group or deemed to have abetted a terrorist act.	B	Lebanon's Hezbollah

Tensions between Saudi Arabia, Iran and their allies escalated in January when Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shiite activist, Nemer al-Nemer.	O	O

Maldives quits Commonwealth over alleged rights abuses
The Maldives has announced it will leave the Commonwealth after mounting pressure from the 53-nation group over corruption and deteriorating human rights in the Indian Ocean state.	O	O
The country’s government, which has been fending off rumours of an impending coup and allegations of money laundering, said the decision on Thursday to cancel its membership was “difficult but inevitable”.	B	Maldives quits Commonwealth
Maldives newspaper raided after corruption claims against president	O	O
Its foreign ministry said in a statement it had been treated “unjustly and unfairly” by the organisation’s Commonwealth ministerial action group (CMAG), which has been scrutinising the government since the former president, Mohamed Nasheed, was ousted in 2012 in what his supporters say was a coup.	B	Commonwealth
“The CMAG and the Commonwealth secretariat seem to be convinced that the Maldives, because of the high and favourable reputation that the country enjoys internationally, and also perhaps because it is a small state that lacks material power, would be an easy object that can be used,” the statement said.	B	Maldives
It added that it was being targeted “in the name of democracy promotion, to increase the [Commonwealth’s] own relevance and leverage in international politics”.	I	Maldives
On 23 September the Maldives government was officially put on notice by CMAG and given six months to address concerns including the detention and prosecution of opposition leaders, meddling with the judiciary and undermining democratic institutions.	O	O
It was the third time the country had been threatened with partial or full suspension from the Commonwealth since Nasheed, the country’s first democratically elected president, was forced out.	O	O
He was replaced by the current president, Abdulla Yameen, in a 2013 poll widely regarded as dubious.	O	O
A September report (pdf) by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), an independent NGO, found “further evidence of curbing fundamental rights, targeted persecution of opposition leaders [and] misuse of state institutions (including the judiciary, legislature and the police) to restrict, crush and punish dissent”.	B	Maldives

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov shakes hands with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi after a joint news conference at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing, China, April 29, 2016.	O	O
- Denouncing what they see as outside interference in the South China Sea and Korean Peninsula, the foreign ministers of Russia and China voiced mutual support Friday as they seek to counter the influence of Washington and its allies, particularly in Asia.	O	O
Following talks in Beijing, Russia's Sergey Lavrov and China's Wang Yi expressed opposition to the U.S. deployment of an anti-missile system in South Korea and said non-claimants should not take sides in the dispute over maritime territorial claims in the South China Sea.	O	O
Despite endorsing United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea over its missile launches and nuclear tests, the two strongly criticized the proposed deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, system.	O	O
Lockheed Martin conducts a successful flight test of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Weapon System at the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, Hawaii, June 29, 2010.	O	O
"Relevant countries shouldn't use Pyongyang's acts as a pretext to increase their military presence on the Korean Peninsula," Lavrov told a joint news conference.	B	U.S.
"We believe the possible deployment of the THAAD anti-missile system won't resolve this problem.	O	O
"Both Russia and China, North Korea's now largely estranged ally, see the deployment as exceeding what is necessary to defend against any North Korean threat and would "directly affect strategic security of Russia and China," Wang said.	O	O
That could "add fuel to the fire of an already tense situation and even possibly wreck the regional strategic balance," Wang said.	O	O
Play Video Obama on challenges posed by North Korea, China Their remarks came days after President Obama told CBS News' Charlie Rose that the U.S. was working fast to position missile defenses in the region.	O	O
Mr. Obama said the U.S. military was "spending a lot more time positioning our missile defense systems, so that even as we try to resolve the underlying problem of nuclear development inside of North Korea, we're also setting up a shield that can at least block the relatively low-level threats that they're posing right now.	O	O
"The president also told Rose that while the U.S. military could "destroy North Korea," such dramatic military intervention was not in the cards due to the huge "humanitarian cost," and the fact that "they are right next door to our vital ally, the Republic of Korea.	O	O
"Lavrov and Wang called for efforts to restart long-stalled six-nation talks on ending North Korea's nuclear programs.	O	O
Their meeting came amid renewed tension on the Korean Peninsula, with South Korean officials saying the North attempted unsuccessfully to test-fire two suspected powerful intermediate-range missiles on Thursday.	O	O

It also comes ahead of a major North Korean ruling party meeting next week at which leader Kim Jong Un is believed to want to place his stamp more forcefully on a government he inherited after his dictator father's death in late 2011.	O	O
On the South China Sea, which China claims almost entirely, Lavrov said outside parties shouldn't interfere, a reference to the United States, which has challenged Beijing's claims.	O	O
Wang said it was up to those countries directly involved to find a peaceful resolution through negotiations.	O	O

U.S. North Korea appears to be preparing a test-launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said on Tuesday, after what the United States described as the “fiery, catastrophic” failure of the first attempt.	B	North Korea Test Fires Submarine-Launched Missile
Separately, President Barack Obama said the United States is working on defending itself and its allies against potential threats from what he called an “erratic” country with an “irresponsible” leader.	B	North Korea
On April 15, the North failed to launch what was likely a Musudan missile, with a range of more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles), meaning it could, if launched successfully, hit Japan and also theoretically put the U.S. territory of Guam within range.	B	North Korea Test Fires Submarine-Launched Missile
The Musudan missile, which can be fired from a mobile launcher, is not known to have been successfully flight-tested.	O	O
In a CBS interview that aired on Tuesday, Obama said the United States “is spending a lot more time positioning our missile development systems, so that even as we try to resolve the underlying problem of nuclear development inside of North Korea, we’re also setting up a shield that can at least block the relatively low-level threats that they’re posing now.

On Saturday, the North conducted a test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile.	O	O
“There are indications that the North may fire a Musudan missile that it launched and failed on Kim Il Sung’s birthday on April 15,” Yonhap quoted an unnamed government official as saying.	B	North Korea Test Fires Submarine-Launched Missile

North and South Korea remain technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, rather than a treaty.	O	O
The North, whose lone major ally is neighbor China, routinely threatens to destroy South Korea and its major ally, the United States.	O	O
Obama said there “was no easy solution” to the North Korean threat, adding that while the United States “could destroy North Korea with our arsenals” there would not only be humanitarian costs but also a potential impact on South Korea.	O	O
The April 15 failure was seen as an embarrassing blow for current leader Kim Jong Un, Kim Il Sung’s grandson, who has claimed several advances in weapons technology in recent months and is widely expected to conduct a fifth nuclear test soon.	O	O
South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun declined to confirm the Yonhap report but said the North’s military would likely spend some time trying to fix the problem following the failed launch.	B	North Korea
Experts see North Korea’s Musudan test as part of an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the mainland United States.	B	Submarine-Launched Missile
“They are erratic enough, their leader is personally irresponsible enough that we don’t want them getting close” to obtaining such weapons, Obama told CBS.	B	North Korea
North Korea said its nuclear test in January was a hydrogen bomb, although that claim has been disputed by foreign governments and experts given the relatively small size of the blast.	O	O
North Korea said its submarine-launched ballistic missile test on Saturday was a “great success” that provided “one more means for powerful nuclear attack.	B	North Korea Test Fires Submarine-Launched Missile
”South Korea on Tuesday described the test, which sent a missile traveling about 30 km (18 miles), as a partial success.	O	O

O	O
Speaking in a rare Western media interview at the UN in New York, the North Korean foreign minister defended his country's right to maintain a nuclear deterrent.	O	O
Ri Su Yong told the Associated Press the US was "totally mistaken" if it thought economic sanctions were enough to stop North Korea's nuclear programme.	B	U.S.
"We made what we consider a very logical proposal to the US government," he said.	O	O
"Stop your nuclear war exercises in the Korean peninsula, then we'll cease nuclear tests.	O	O
"Asked about the comments at a news conference on his arrival in Germany, Barack Obama said the US was not taking them seriously.	B	North Korea
The president told reporters that a commitment to reducing tensions was not shown "based on a press release", and that North Korea would have to do better.	I	North Korea
Mr Ri's comments came on Saturday as the North Korean government announced it had successfully launched a ballistic missile from a submarine, a development which could render the country capable of launching a nuclear weapon without warning.	O	O
This picture released from North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on April 24, 2016 shows the underwater test-fire of a strategic submarine ballistic missile at an undisclosed location in North Korea on April 23, 2016 (KCNA)South Korean media quoted military officials reporting the launch some hours earlier, saying the missile travelled some 30km before falling into the sea off North Korea's eastern coast.	O	O
Mr Ri called on the US to to suspend its military exercises first in order to open the door to talks and end the escalation of tensions.	O	O
"If we continue on this path of confrontation, this will lead to very catastrophic results, not only for the two countries but for the whole entire world as well," he said.	O	O
Picture released from North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on April 24, 2016 shows the underwater test-fire of a strategic submarine ballistic missile at an undisclosed location in North Korea on April 23, 2016 (KCNA)"It is really crucial for the US government to withdraw its hostile policy against the DPRK and as an expression of this stop the military exercises, war exercises, in the Korean Peninsula.	O	O
Then we will respond likewise.	O	O
"The US responded to the submarine missile launch by saying it would limit Mr Ri's movements during his visit, adding that "launches using ballistic missile technology are a clear violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions".	O	O
"We call on North Korea to refrain from actions that further destabilise the region and focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its commitments and international obligations," a spokesman for the State Department said.	B	North Korea
During the wide-reaching interview with AP, the North Korean minister was asked about the case of an American student sentenced to 15 years' hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda poster during a tourist trip to Pyongyang.	O	O
Mr Ri defended the sentence and said the case of 21-year-old Otto Warmbier was being used by Washington "as a tactic to make our lives difficult".	O	O
He said he would nonetheless relay back to North Korea the US concerns over the student's treatment.	O	O
And the minister rejected suggestions that North Korea was a hermit kingdom, closed off to external scrutiny.	O	O
"We have our doors open for anybody who is interested to come to the DPRK and see the reality," he said, thought he added there would be risks for visitors who "totally fabricate" the situation in the country.	O	O

North Korea's Jong Un more aggressive than father: U.S. general
North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un appears more “risk-tolerant, arrogant and impulsive” than his father as he forges ahead with military programs that have left even China - Pyongyang’s top ally - feeling frustrated, a top U.S. general said on Tuesday.	O	O
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un salutes as he arrives to inspect a military drill at an unknown location, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on March 25, 2016.	O	O
REUTERS/KCNAArmy General Vincent Brooks, who is President Barack Obama’s nominee to lead American forces in South Korea, told a Senate hearing that he was “not optimistic” about North Korea’s direction.	B	North Korea
The reclusive state conducted a fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February, both in contravention of U.N. Security Council resolutions.	B	North Korea
Last week, it failed to launch what the United States believes was an intermediate-range ballistic missile.	O	O
“Compared to his father, Kim Jong Un is more aggressive with advancing the North’s nuclear program and ignoring international concerns,” Brooks said in written responses to questions from the Senate Armed Services Committee.	O	O
He noted Kim’s purges and executions of senior officials since he succeeded his father, Kim Jong Il, who died in 2011, adding: “We now see greater potential for instability as a result of Kim Jong Un’s behaviors and the absence of advisers he is willing to consult.	O	O
”Some experts expect North Korea to conduct its fifth nuclear test in the near future, possibly before its party congress in early May.	B	North Korea
Brooks said at his Senate confirmation hearing that some Chinese military leaders have told him “they don’t have the influence they once had” with Pyongyang, although he questioned that.	O	O
“It is my assessment that China is in fact frustrated, yet unwilling to apply pressures that could threaten the viability of the North Korea” regime, he said in written responses to the committee.	O	O
In March, North Korea said it had miniaturized a nuclear warhead to be mounted on ballistic missiles and a simulated re-entry test of a ballistic missile, which could indicate advances in its ICBM program, if true.	O	O
[ nL3N17B4GZ]But South Korean officials questioned those assertions and said the North was several years away from developing an ICBM.	O	O
Brooks restated the U.S. military’s position that it must be prepared defensively by assuming the worst.	B	U.S.
“Given the amount of time and resources the regime devotes to nuclear and missile programs, we must assume North Korea has the technical capability to mount and deliver a nuclear warhead using ballistic missiles,” he said.	O	O
Brooks added that South Korea was carrying a “significant load” when it comes to U.S. forces in South Korea.	O	O
He said that South Korea was paying for 92 percent of a $10.8 billion U.S.	O	O

Kim Jong Un reportedly launches missiles at random when US provokes him
North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un randomly fires off missiles whenever he gets upset about the United States’ demands, his father’s former sushi chef revealed Wednesday, as the country appeared to be gearing up for its next launch.	O	O
Kenji Fujimoto, now living in Japan, told the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun that Kim Jong Un made the admission during a recent trip to Pyongyang.	O	O
"I have no intention of waging war," Kim said, according to Fujimoto.	O	O
"It's that whenever a diplomat tries to approach the U.S., they come up with unreasonable demands.	B	U.S.
They aggravate me, so I launch missiles.	I	U.S.
”The former chef suggested that Kim was irritated by U.S. sanctions and military threats from rivals, UPI reported, citing South Korean news service News 1.	O	O
Fujimoto has worked with the Kim family since the 1980s and left North Korea in 2001.	O	O
Since then, he reportedly has advised Kim on North Korea-Japan relations.	O	O
"They aggravate me, so I launch missiles.	B	U.S.
" - Kim Jong Un during a meeting in Pyongyang, according to Kenji Fujimoto "[Secretary Kim] said that he thought it would be a good idea if I played a bridging role between Pyongyang and the Japanese government," he said.	O	O
The dictator's father, Kim Jong Il, led North Korea from 1994 until his death in 2011.	O	O
A government official in Seoul told South Korea's Yonhap news agency on Tuesday that its military had evidence indicating North Korea could soon launch a midrange missile.	O	O
Also, South Korea said Wednesday that the North has built a half-size mock-up of the South's presidential palace at a firing range in what appears to be preparations for a live-fire drill.	O	O
An official from the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff, who didn't want to be named, citing office rules, said the information came from an analysis of South Korean satellite imagery, The Associated Press reported.	O	O
North Korea in recent weeks has repeatedly threatened to strike the presidential palace and government buildings in Seoul amid annual joint military drills between the United States and South Korea.	O	O
But a pre-emptive large-scale strike by North Korea against the South is highly unlikely, The Associated Press reported.	O	O
Such a move would risk bringing down Kim's authoritarian rule given the likely military response of the U.S. and South Korea.	O	O
The crippling international sanctions imposed on North Korea for its nuclear tests have been taking its toll on the country, as Kim announced in late March that North Korea could be headed for another famine like the one that killed an estimated 3.5 million people in the 1990s.	O	O
"The road to revolution is long and arduous," an editorial in the state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper said, according to The Telegraph.	O	O
"We may have to go on an arduous march, during which we will have to chew the roots of plants once again.	O	O
" Meanwhile, South Korean analysts said recently that Kim himself apparently gained more than 80 pounds in the last year.	O	O

North Korea appears to fire submarine-launched missile, Seoul says
North Korea on Saturday fired what appeared to be a ballistic missile from a submarine off its northeast coast, South Korean defense officials said, Pyongyang's latest effort to expand its military might in the face of pressure by its neighbors and Washington.	B	North Korea Test Fires Submarine-Launched Missile
The South Korean officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of office rules, could not immediately confirm where the projectile landed.	O	O
The Saturday evening launch of what the officials said was presumably a submarine-launched ballistic missile took place near the North Korean coastal town of Sinpo, where analysts have previously detected efforts by the North to develop submarine-launched ballistic missile systems.	O	O
A successful test from a submarine would be a worrying development because mastering the ability to fire missiles from submerged vessels would make it harder for outsiders to detect what North Korea is doing before it launches, giving it the potential to surprise its enemies.	B	North Korea Test Fires Submarine-Launched Missile
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the projectile fired by the North on Saturday traveled about 19 miles.	O	O
It said a typical submarine-launched ballistic missile can travel at least 186 miles.	O	O
The North last test-launched a submarine-launched ballistic missile on Dec. 25, but that test was seen as failure, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.	O	O
The U.S. State Department would not comment on the reports of Saturday's launch, but noted, "Launches using ballistic missile technology are a clear violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions.	B	North Korea Test Fires Submarine-Launched Missile
""We call on North Korea to refrain from actions that further destabilize the region and focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its commitments and international obligations," said State Department spokesman John Kirby.	B	North Korea
North Korea has recently sent a barrage of missiles and artillery shells into the sea amid ongoing annual military drills between the United States and South Korea.	O	O
Pyongyang says the drills are a preparation for an invasion of the North.	O	O
The firings also come as the North expresses anger about toughened international sanctions over its recent nuclear test and long-range rocket launch.	O	O
North Korea's belligerence may also be linked to a major ruling party congress next month meant to further cement leader Kim Jong Un's grip on power.	B	Test Fires Submarine-Launched Missile
Promoting military accomplishments could be an attempt to overshadow a lack of economic achievements ahead of the Workers' Party congress, the first since 1980.	O	O

Russia, China in agreement on North Korea, South China Sea
Denouncing what they see as outside interference in the South China Sea and Korean Peninsula, the foreign ministers of Russia and China voiced mutual support Friday as they seek to counter the influence of Washington and its allies, particularly in Asia.	O	O
Following talks in Beijing, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov and China’s Wang Yi expressed opposition to the U.S. deployment of an anti-missile system in South Korea and said non-claimants should not take sides in the dispute over maritime territorial claims in the South China Sea.	O	O
Despite endorsing United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea over its missile launches and nuclear tests, the two strongly criticized the proposed deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, system.	O	O
“Relevant countries shouldn’t use Pyongyang’s acts as a pretext to increase their military presence on the Korean Peninsula,” Lavrov told a joint news conference.	B	U.S.
“We believe the possible deployment of the THAAD anti-missile system won’t resolve this problem.	O	O
”Both Russia and China, North Korea’s now largely estranged ally, see the deployment as exceeding what is necessary to defend against any North Korean threat and would “directly affect strategic security of Russia and China,” Wang said.	O	O
That could “add fuel to the fire of an already tense situation and even possibly wreck the regional strategic balance,” Wang said.	O	O
Both men called for efforts to restart long-stalled six-nation talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear programs.	O	O
Their meeting came amid renewed tension on the Korean Peninsula, with South Korean officials saying the North attempted unsuccessfully to test-fire two suspected powerful intermediate-range missiles on Thursday.	O	O
It also comes ahead of a major North Korean ruling party meeting next week at which leader Kim Jong Un is believed to want to place his stamp more forcefully on a government he inherited after his dictator father’s death in late 2011.	O	O
On the South China Sea, which China claims almost entirely, Lavrov said outside parties shouldn’t interfere, a reference to the United States, which has challenged Beijing’s claims.	O	O
Wang said it was up to those countries directly involved to find a peaceful resolution through negotiations.	O	O
“International society, particularly countries from outside the South China Sea, should play a constructive function in maintaining peace and stability and not contribute to the situation becoming more chaotic,” Wang said.	B	U.S.
Criticized over its aggressive tactics and construction of new islands with airfields, harbors and radar stations, China has sought to use Russia to bulk up its side of the argument against the U.S. and claimants such as the Philippines, which has brought a suit at the U.N.	O	O
Court of Arbitration seeking a ruling on ownership over territories it claims.	O	O
China has refused to take part in the arbitration or recognize the court’s ruling.	O	O
Along with enlisting Russia’s support, China has given heavy publicity to what it calls a new consensus reached with Brunei, Cambodia and Laos — three members of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations — endorsing its stance that the South China Sea dispute should not be an issue for ASEAN as a whole.	O	O
That has renewed criticisms from some that China is applying divide-and-conquer tactics with its smaller neighbors and trying to drive a wedge through the organization.	O	O
ASEAN members Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines contest China’s claims, while Taiwan also claims much of the area.	O	O
While the U.S. says it takes no position on South China Sea sovereignty claims, it has worked to shore up the military capabilities of the Philippines, a treaty ally.	B	U.S.
Washington has also called on China to end its island-building projects and the U.S. Navy has repeatedly sailed and flown ships and planes nearby those structures, drawing sharp responses from the Chinese navy.	O	O
Wang and Lavrov both hailed two decades of warming ties between Moscow and Beijing, bitter Cold War rivals for a quarter century, who under Russian President Vladimir Putin have found common cause in challenging the West.	O	O
Russia has become a leading supplier of imported high-tech weaponry and resources such as oil and gas, while China is a major source of capital investment for projects in Russia.	O	O
Putin is scheduled to visit China in June.	O	O

Why North Korean threat is a more urgent issue for next U.S. President
Kim Jong Un has been intensifying his efforts to develop a long-range nuclear strike capability since the beginning of 2016.	O	O
The more vulnerable he feels atop a weakening North Korea, the more he seeks a silver bullet to ensure the regime's long-term survival.	B	North Korea
This dynamic has been in play for decades, especially as North Korea pursued nuclear weapons to compensate for the loss of its powerful patrons in Moscow and Beijing and fell further behind a far more prosperous South Korea.	I	North Korea
But Pyongyang's insecurity has intensified even more under Kim, who, since coming to power in 2012, declared his father's bequest of a nuclear program as a crowning achievement, changed the constitution to declare North Korea a nuclear state, and declared nuclear and economic development as his twin priorities.	I	North Korea
Kim's recent declaration that the North has developed a hydrogen bomb and a failed submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) test marked the opening of Kim's nuclear sprint in December of 2015.	O	O
Then came North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January, its long-range missile launch in February, the unveiling of a miniaturized nuclear warhead and announcement of successful atmospheric reentry tests of a rocket warhead in March, and then tests of the mobile ground-launched Musudan missile along with another SLBM test in April.	O	O
Kim has also announced that North Korea will soon conduct its fifth nuclear test.	O	O
Kim has timed North Korea's nuclear sprint to coincide with internal and external objectives.	O	O
First, he set the date for an historic seventh conference of the Korean Worker's Party for May 2016.	O	O
Second, Kim used international condemnation under UN Security Council Resolution 2270 and the holding of annual U.S.-ROK Key Resolve/Foal Eagle military exercises in March and April as further justification to intensify his nuclear push.	O	O
The third reason for North Korea's nuclear dash may be influenced by the U.S. political calendar.	O	O
The Obama administration's main tool to blunt North Korea's crisis escalation tactics has been an approach known as "strategic patience.	O	O
" An underlying premise enabling such an approach for the last eight years has been the knowledge that North Korea's pace of nuclear and missile development was not rapid enough to enable Pyongyang to be able to directly strike the United States with a nuclear weapon on the Obama administration's watch.	O	O
As a result, the White House could use pressure to slow North Korea's program while pushing Pyongyang to return to denuclearization talks.	O	O
But the next U.S. administration is likely to see the North Korean threat as a more urgent priority because the North may indeed develop a long-range nuclear strike capability within the next four years.	B	U.S.
Such a development will enhance North Korea's leverage and demands for talks but will also generate greater pressure on the next U.S. President to consider decisive action, possibly including military options.	O	O
This prospect provides Kim with an incentive to pursue a nuclear sprint, both to lock in capabilities that will enhance North Korea's deterrent against the United States and to seal North Korea's status as a nuclear power in any future international negotiations, such as the North's proposal for peace talks in exchange for cessation of military exercises -- but not in exchange for denuclearization.	O	O
If North Korea conducts another nuclear test, there are few additional non-military measures the international community can pursue, and North Korea is counting on China's desire for stability and for a strategic buffer to protect North Korea against externally-imposed measures for regime change.	B	North Korea
On May 6, Kim may enjoy a Korean Worker's Party conference that will celebrate his achievements and consolidate his rule.	O	O
He may even think that his nuclear deterrent has bought time and saved money that can be used to improve North Korea's economy.	O	O
But the regime's own systemic need to generate instability as a primary means of exerting domestic political control guarantees that the young leader will never have enough nuclear weapons to achieve absolute security.	B	North Korea

North Korean Missile Test Fails Just Seconds After Launch, Official Says
North Korea fired what appeared to have been an intermediate range ballistic missile on Thursday but it crashed seconds after the test launch, South Korea’s defense ministry said, the second such failure in the run-up to next week’s ruling party congress.	B	North Korea Test Fires Submarine-Launched Missile
Isolated North Korea has conducted a flurry of missile launches, in violation of U.N. resolutions, and tests of military technology ahead of the Workers’ Party congress that begins on May 6, and Thursday’s launch looks to have been hurried, according to a defense expert in Seoul. that the launch at about 6:40 a.m. local time (2140 GMT Wednesday) from near the east coast city of Wonsan appeared to have been of a Musudan missile with a range of more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles).	B	North Korea
It crashed within seconds, the official said.	O	O
“They are in a rush to show anything that is successful, to meet the schedule of a political event, the party congress,” said Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum and a policy adviser to the South Korean navy.	B	North Korea
“They need to succeed but they keep failing.	I	North Korea
They didn’t have enough time to fix or technically modify the system, but just shot them because they were in hurry,” he said.	I	North Korea
Thursday’s apparent failure marks another setback for the North’s young leader Kim Jong Un.	O	O
A similar missile launched on the April 15 birthday of his grandfather, the country’s founder, Kim Il Sung, exploded in what the U.S.	O	O
Defense Department called a “fiery, catastrophic” failure.	O	O
Some experts had predicted that North Korea would wait until it had figured out what went wrong in the previous failed Musudan missile launch before attempting another, a process that could take months and a sign that Thursday’s firing was rushed.	B	North Korea Test Fires
However, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency had reported on Tuesday that the North appeared to be preparing the second launch of a Musudan, which theoretically has the range to reach any part of Japan and the U.S. territory of Guam.	O	O

“Signs for an imminent fifth nuclear test are being detected ahead of North Korea’s seventh Party Congress,” President Park Geun-hye said at a national security meeting on Thursday.	O	O
The defense ministry official, who declined to be identified by name, said South Korean and U.S. officials were analyzing the cause of Thursday’s missile crash, declining to comment on why news of the launch was revealed several hours after it took place.	O	O
Yonhap said the fired missile was not detected by South Korean military radar because it did not fly above a few hundred meters, and was spotted by a U.S. satellite.	O	O
The South Korean defense ministry told Reuters it could not confirm that report.	O	O
North Korea’s missile tests are in defiance of United Nations Security Council sanctions against the country, which were strengthened following a January nuclear test and a space rocket launch the following month.	B	North Korea Test Fires

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi walk to their meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing on Friday.	O	O
| REUTERSBEIJING – Denouncing what they see as outside interference in the South China Sea and Korean Peninsula, the foreign ministers of Russia and China voiced mutual support Friday as they seek to counter the influence of Washington and its allies, particularly in Asia.	O	O
Following talks in Beijing, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov and China’s Wang Yi expressed opposition to the U.S. deployment of an anti-missile system in South Korea and said non-claimants should not take sides in the dispute over maritime territorial claims in the South China Sea.	O	O
Despite endorsing United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea over its missile launches and nuclear tests, the two strongly criticized the proposed deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, system.	O	O
“Relevant countries shouldn’t use Pyongyang’s acts as a pretext to increase their military presence on the Korean Peninsula,” Lavrov told a joint news conference.	B	U.S.
“We believe the possible deployment of the THAAD anti-missile system won’t resolve this problem.	O	O
”Both Russia and China, North Korea’s now largely estranged ally, see the deployment as exceeding what is necessary to defend against any North Korean threat and would “directly affect strategic security of Russia and China,” Wang said.	O	O
That could “add fuel to the fire of an already tense situation and even possibly wreck the regional strategic balance,” Wang said.	O	O
Both men called for efforts to restart long-stalled six-nation talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear programs.	O	O
Their meeting came amid renewed tension on the Korean Peninsula, with South Korean officials saying the North unsuccessfully attempted to test-fire two suspected powerful intermediate-range missiles on Thursday.	O	O
It also comes ahead of a major North Korean ruling party meeting next week at which leader Kim Jong Un is believed to want to place his stamp more forcefully on a government he inherited after his dictator father’s death in late 2011.	O	O
On the South China Sea, which China claims almost entirely, Lavrov said outside parties shouldn’t interfere, a reference to the United States, which has challenged Beijing’s claims.	B	U.S.
Wang said it was up to those countries directly involved to find a peaceful resolution through negotiations.	O	O
“International society, particularly countries from outside the South China Sea, should play a constructive function in maintaining peace and stability and not contribute to the situation becoming more chaotic,” Wang said.	O	O
Criticized over its aggressive tactics and construction of new islands with airfields, harbors and radar stations, China has sought to use Russia to bulk up its side of the argument against the U.S. and claimants such as the Philippines, which has brought a suit at the U.N.	O	O
Court of Arbitration seeking a ruling on ownership over territories it claims.	O	O
China has refused to take part in the arbitration or recognize the court’s ruling.	O	O
Along with enlisting Russia’s support, China has given heavy publicity to what it calls a new consensus reached with Brunei, Cambodia and Laos — three members of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations — endorsing its stance that the South China Sea dispute should not be an issue for ASEAN as a whole.	O	O
That has renewed criticisms from some that China is applying divide-and-conquer tactics with its smaller neighbors and trying to drive a wedge through the organization.	O	O
ASEAN members Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines contest China’s claims, while Taiwan also claims much of the area.	O	O
While the U.S. says it takes no position on South China Sea sovereignty claims, it has worked to shore up the military capabilities of the Philippines, a treaty ally.	O	O
Washington has also called on China to end its island-building projects and the U.S. Navy has repeatedly sailed and flown ships and planes nearby those structures, drawing sharp responses from the Chinese navy.	O	O
Wang and Lavrov both hailed two decades of warming ties between Moscow and Beijing, bitter Cold War rivals for a quarter century, who under Russian President Vladimir Putin have found common cause in challenging the West.	O	O
Russia has become a leading supplier of imported high-tech weaponry and resources such as oil and gas, while China is a major source of capital investment for projects in Russia.	O	O
Putin is scheduled to visit China in June.	O	O

Missiles paraded in Pyongyang, North Korea, last October.
North Korea is still defying the international community with its nuclear weapons program, and it now may have enough fissile material for 20 bombs.	B	North Korea
Its nuclear-related activity has surged this year, part of an effort by its leader, Kim Jong-un, to enhance his influence ahead of a rare congress of his ruling Workers’ Party.	I	North Korea
The congress is set to open on May 6.	O	O
In January, the North carried out its fourth nuclear test, and the following month it conducted a test of a long-range ballistic missile, the kind that could one day carry a nuclear weapon to hit the United States.	O	O
It claimed to have tested a more powerful rocket engine and to have succeeded at shrinking the size of a nuclear weapon so it can fit on a missile.	O	O
In April, North Korea fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile and also made three attempts at launching a powerful intermediate-range mobile missile called the Musudan.	O	O
Though the four most recent tests failed in one way or another, North Korea’s overall activity this year has raised regional tensions and highlighted the inability of the major powers, specifically the United States and China, to curb the North’s dangerous ambitions.	B	North Korea Test Fires
Missiles paraded in Pyongyang, North Korea, last October.	O	O
Even the United Nations Security Council’s decision in March to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea — a decision in which China, North Korea’s chief ally, concurred — seems to be having little impact.	O	O
Doubts persist about China’s commitment to enforcing them.	O	O
The launch failures are an embarrassment for Mr. Kim and have led to speculation that he might attempt another nuclear test — North Korea’s fifth since 2006 — before the party congress, where he hopes to tighten his grip on power.	O	O
That would inevitably lead to more sanctions and accelerate talks between the United States and South Korea on stationing missile defenses in South Korea.	O	O
While sanctions are important and China, more than any other country, has the power to make North Korea feel their effects, sanctions alone are not enough to mitigate the threat.	O	O
Backing an inexperienced and reckless leader like Mr. Kim into a corner is risky and might lead to even more dangerous responses, like aiming a weapon at South Korea or Japan, with potentially catastrophic results.	O	O
At some point, the United States, along with China, South Korea, Japan and Russia, will have to find a way to revive negotiations aimed at curbing North Korea’s nuclear program.	O	O
The Obama administration earlier this year had secret contacts with the North that foundered over a disagreement on whether to focus on denuclearization (America’s priority) or on replacing the current Korean War armistice with a formal peace treaty (North Korea’s priority).	O	O
But the idea of talking with the North is politically unpopular in America, and this is an election year.	O	O
An opportunity to get the dialogue going again may present itself after the party congress.	O	O
Robert Carlin, a retired C.I.A. and State Department analyst of North Korea, writes in the 38 North blog of seeing signs that Mr. Kim could by then feel confident enough in North Korea’s nuclear deterrent to shift attention to reforming the economy while pushing again for a new peace proposal.	O	O
If something like that happens, the administration should be nimble and creative enough to work with such a proposal, despite the obvious difficulties of dealing with Mr. Kim.	O	O
So far, though, President Obama has shown little interest in applying the approach that he pursued successfully with Iran — a combination of sanctions and negotiations — to North Korea.	O	O

UN Security Council Syria emergency meeting
The UN Security Council is holding a closed emergency meeting on Syria after UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, warned Thursday that the lives of some 275,000 people are hanging in the balance as the Russian and Syrian government air bombardment of Aleppo continues unabated.	O	O
“In maximum two months, two-and-a-half months, the city of eastern Aleppo may be totally destroyed,” de Mistura said.	B	Aleppo
The Kremlin says Russian fighter jets are “assisting Syria’s armed forces in the fight against terrorism,” while de Mistura, who is briefing the Security Council today via video link in Geneva, has implored Russia to halt its airstrikes to end the terrible suffering of Aleppo’s residents and allow a few hundred jihadi fighters holed up in the city to leave.	O	O
“If you decide to leave with dignity… I am personally ready to physically accompany you,” de Mistura said, urging former Al-Nusra Front fighters in eastern Aleppo to leave in a deal that would end the brutal air campaign against the city and its residents.	O	O
Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Russia’s Channel One news that Moscow is “ready to urge” the Syrian government to agree to De Mistura’s proposal to allow the Al-Nusra fighters out of eastern Aleppo in exchange for a temporary cessation of hostilities.	O	O
On Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the United States ended talks with Moscow on Syria over Russia’s stepped up air campaign in Aleppo.	O	O
Moscow and Washington accuse each other of breaking a fragile ceasefire last month.	O	O
Russia has since deployed advanced S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air-missiles to Syria.	O	O
And yesterday, a Russian defense ministry spokesman warned that any US aircraft attempting to launch strikes may be shot down by the Russia air defenses.	O	O
Security Council members are discussing a French-drafted resolution that demands a ceasefire in Aleppo.	O	O
Fox News saw an initial draft of the resolution which called for the suspension of all aerial military activity over the war-torn city.	O	O
The measure also called for the delivery of humanitarian aid and the establishment of a mechanism to monitor the ceasefire.	O	O
Russia’s Ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said earlier this week that the resolution in its current form “has no chance of working,” essentially threatening to veto.	B	UN Resolution
Moscow’s deployment of advanced air defenses in Syria is viewed by Western diplomats as a move that would deter any attempt by the West to impose a no-fly zone over Syria, a long-standing appeal by Syria’s opposition.	O	O
France may call for a vote on its draft resolution as early as Friday.	O	O
Russia’s UN, Vitaly Churkin, said a short time ago outside the Security Council that “the French draft contains elements that we think are harmful,” hinting Moscow’s intention to veto.	B	Resolution

Syrian government forces kept up their blistering assault on rebel-held eastern Aleppo after a divided UN Security Council failed to agree on a truce to save the war-battered city, while Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) yesterday pleaded for access to treat the wounded in the eastern sector.	O	O
Regime forces and their allies were advancing street by street in the eastern sector, which has been out of government hands since 2012.	O	O
Clashes on the ground, as well as fierce airstrikes, went on all night and continued Sunday, especially in the Sheikh Said district, said Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.	O	O
The army launched its assault on the besieged sector of Aleppo more than two weeks ago with the backing of Russian airstrikes, aiming to reunite the city, which was Syria’s economic hub before its conflict erupted in 2011.	O	O
Airstrikes and artillery fire by the regime and its Russian ally killed 290 people, mostly civilians and including 57 children, since the Sept. 22 launch of operations in Aleppo, the observatory said.	O	O
The Britain-based monitor, which compiles its information from sources on the ground, said 50 civilians, including nine children, have also died in rebel bombardment of regime-controlled western districts.	O	O
Syria’s official Syrian Arab News Agency on Sunday said that rebel shelling killed a baby and wounded two people in the Hamdaniyeh neighborhood.	O	O
MSF, which supports eight hospitals in the eastern quarters, said only 35 doctors are left serving in eastern Aleppo, amid an estimated population of 275,000.	O	O
The organization said that the medical workers in Aleppo are exhausted and facilities overstretched and facing an impending fuel shortage.	O	O
On Saturday at the UN, Russia vetoed a French-drafted resolution demanding an end to the bombing of Aleppo, but its own rival measure on a truce was rejected.	O	O
The failure of the two resolutions deepened divisions at the Security Council between Moscow and the Western powers backing rebel forces in Syria’s five-year war, which has killed more than 300,000 people.	O	O
It was the fifth time that Russia used its veto to block UN action on the war in Syria.	O	O

Syria talks involving US to take place this weekend, says Lavrov
An unexpected round of multilateral talks on the future of Syria is to start on Saturday involving initially Russia, the US, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and possibly Qatar, the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said.	O	O
The talks will be held in Lausanne, Switzerland. he hoped that a meeting involving only those “with direct influence on the ground” in Syria would allow “a businesslike discussion, not another general assembly like debate”.	O	O
It was not immediately clear whether Iran would be represented.	O	O
The UK, France and other European states will be excluded from the Lausanne meeting, but the US secretary of state, John Kerry, is expected to brief European foreign ministers in London afterwards.	O	O
Ground down by savagery – the agony of Aleppo	B	Aleppo
Kerry announced he was ending bilateral contacts with Russia after a US-Russia brokered ceasefire broke down after less than a week, when the Syrian regime declared it over and resumed a Russian-backed air offensive against rebel-held eastern Aleppo.	B	Russia
However, the state department said at the time that multilateral meetings on Syria would continue, including Russia.	O	O
The state department, announcing Kerry’s weekend talks, said tthe Lausanne and London talks were to “discuss a multilateral approach to resolving the crisis in Syria, including a sustained cessation of violence and the resumption of humanitarian aid deliveries”.	O	O
The US, UK and France have called for Russia and the Syrian regime to be investigated for war crimes.	O	O
President Vladimir Putin countered by shelving a 2000 deal on the disposal of weapons-grade plutonium and cancelling a bilateral agreement on research cooperation between Russia and US nuclear sectors.	O	O
In his CNN interview, Lavrov derided Boris Johnson who was the first official to publicly accuse Russia of taking part in the 19 September bombing of an UN aid convoy.	O	O
Lavrov said the UK foreign secretary of arrogance and being a “Jack of all trades”, going from being from a mayor and “a friend of Russia” to “getting ready to become to some kind of international recognised prosecutor general in the Hague.	O	O
”The Russian foreign minister claimed that Moscow was taking “all necessary precautions to advise the Syrian army to be very specific and very targeted in its actions towards Nusra”.	O	O
Lavrov accused the former al-Nusra Front, now known as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, thought to number about 1000, of using eastern Aleppo’s 275,000 population as “human shields”.	O	O
A French effort to secure a ceasefire agreement at the UN security council at the weekend was vetoed by Russia on the grounds there was no clear commitment that jihadi forces in eastern Aleppo would leave the city.	O	O
The presence of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar at the Lausanne meeting suggests there will be a focus on whether non-jihadi Syrian opposition fighters are willing to disentangle themselves from al-Nusra Front.	O	O
Although al-Nusra has changed its name, both the US and Russia believe the group has retained its links to al-Qaida, and must therefore be regarded as a proscribed group.	O	O
But many opposition fighters backed by the west will not break with al-Nusra.	O	O
The UN has been trying to revive the ceasefire by proposing that 1,000 or so of the jihadi group’s fighters be escorted from Aleppo to a safe place in return for a commitment from Moscow that Russian and Syrian air forces will cease airstrike and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to the 250,000 civilians in the city.	O	O
On Tuesday, Putin cancelled a trip to Paris, accusing the French of trying to set up a Russian veto on Syria at the UN security council last weekend.	O	O
France claimed the Russian president was embarrassed to talk about Syria.	O	O
Western officials are increasingly convinced that Russia uses diplomatic negotiations as a cover to continue military activity in Syria and say that the west can no longer afford to believe Russia is seriously seeking a diplomatic solution instead of a military one.	B	Russia
Diplomats believe a wider ceasefire in Syria – let alone peace talks to end the conflict – will not be considered unless there is an end to to the impasse over Aleppo.	O	O
Separately there are German-led discussions under way on whether economic sanctions should be widened against Russia.	O	O
Germany has previously been seen as one of the countries least eager to impose wider sanctions on Russia, but the issue is likely to be discussed at the next meeting of EU heads of state in Brussels on 20 October.	O	O
In response to that sanctions threat, the speaker of Russia’s upper house of parliament, Valentina Matvienko, said: “Only the United Nations is authorised to impose sanctions in case of grave rights violations.	O	O
All other sanctions, including those against Russia, are illegitimate and unlawful.	O	O
”The leaders of Russia, Germany, France and Ukraine are due to meet in an attempt to find a peace settlement in eastern Ukraine, one of the issues that has damaged Russian relations with Europe.	O	O
The meeting will only go ahead, probably next Wednesday, if there is a sign that it will reach an agreement on the next stage of de-escalation set out in the Minsk agreement.	O	O

The aftermath of an air strike in a rebel-held area of Aleppo
The aftermath of an air strike in a rebel-held area of AleppoVladamir Putin has indefinitely postponed a trip to France after Paris revised his schedule so it focused on the crisis in Syria, French President Francois Hollande has said.	O	O
The claim is the latest episode in the deteriorating relationship between Moscow and the West over Russia’s support for President Bashar al-Assad and their bombardment of Aleppo.	O	O
The Russian President was expected to visit France next Tuesday, but Mr Putin suspended the trip after learning he would attend meetings to discuss Syria instead of attending Russian cultural events, Mr Hollande has claimed.	O	O
Over the weekend, Russia blocked a UN resolution for a ceasefire proposed by France and Spain.	O	O
France’s foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault then said he would ask the International Court of Justice to investigate Russia’s part in possible war crimes in Syria.	O	O
“France has a major disagreement with Russia over Syria,” Mr Hollande said on Tuesday.	O	O
“And the Russian veto to the French resolution at the UN council has prevented the cessation of the bombings, as well as the proclamation of a ceasefire.	B	Russia
”Yet he added that for the humanitarian disaster to end, communication with Moscow was needed.	O	O
“The main victims are the civilians who live and die under the bombs,” Mr Hollande said.	O	O
“That’s the reason why I consider that a dialogue with Russia is necessary.	O	O
But it should be firm and open.	O	O
Otherwise it’s a mockery.	O	O
”The Kremlin confirmed Mr Putin’s decision to cancel, but made no mention of Syria and said he was ready to come to Paris at Mr Hollande’s convenience.	O	O
Russian jets resumed heavy bombing of eastern Aleppo on Tuesday after several days of relative calm, a rebel official and the Britain-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.	O	O
Air strikes on the besieged part of the city killed at least eight people Tuesday, while shelling of a government-held neighbourhood in a southern Syrian city hit a school, killing at least six people, among them children, activists and state media said.	O	O
Before the change in agenda, Mr Putin’s visit to Paris included attending the opening of Russian cultural centre and orthodox church.	O	O
Mr Putin’s spokesperson said: “Regrettably, those events dropped out of the programme.	O	O
The president decided to cancel the visit.	O	O
”Mr Peskov said Mr Putin could visit France at a later date which would be “comfortable” for Mr Hollande.	O	O
He denied that the cancelled visit reflected Moscow’s increasing diplomatic isolation over Syria.	O	O
“No, the president hasn't found himself in isolation,” Mr Peskov said, and he dismissed the claim as “absurd”.	O	O
“Russia and its president aren’t facing anything of the kind.	B	Russia
”In the UK, ahead of an emergency commons debate on the crisis in Aleppo, former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell compared Russia’s actions in the Syrian conflict to that of the Nazis before World War II.	O	O
Mr Mitchell said Russia has “shredded” international law by providing military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s bombing campaign of rebel neighbourhoods.	B	Russia
“We are witnessing events which match the behaviour of the Nazi regime in Guernica in Spain,” he said.	O	O
During the debate in the commons, Conservative MP Stephen Crabbe said Russia was behaving like a “thuggish international gangster” in it's disregard for international humanitarian law.	B	Russia

Syrians inspect damage after a government airstrike in Aleppo (Syrian Civil Defense White Helmets via AP)The UN Security Council held a closed-door emergency meeting on Syria Friday, one day after U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura warned that the lives of some 275,000 people were hanging in the balance as the Russian and Syrian government air bombardment of Aleppo continued unabated.	O	O
“In maximum two months, two-and-a-half months, the city of eastern Aleppo may be totally destroyed,” de Mistura said.	B	Aleppo
The Kremlin said Russian fighter jets were “assisting Syria’s armed forces in the fight against terrorism.	O	O
” De Mistura, who was briefing the Security Council via video link in Geneva, implored Russia to halt its airstrikes to end the terrible suffering of Aleppo’s residents and allow a few hundred jihadi fighters holed up in the city to leave.	O	O
“If you decide to leave with dignity… I am personally ready to physically accompany you,” de Mistura said, urging former Al-Nusra Front fighters in eastern Aleppo to leave in a deal that would end the brutal air campaign against the city and its residents.	O	O
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Russia’s Channel One news that Moscow was “ready to urge” the Syrian government to agree to de Mistura’s proposal to allow the Al-Nusra fighters out of eastern Aleppo in exchange for a temporary cessation of hostilities.	O	O
On Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the United States ended talks with Moscow on Syria over Russia’s stepped up air campaign in Aleppo.	O	O
Moscow and Washington accused each other of breaking a fragile ceasefire last month.	O	O
Russia has since deployed advanced S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air-missiles to Syria.	O	O
And Thursday, a Russian defense ministry spokesman warned that any U.S. aircraft attempting to launch strikes may be shot down by the Russia air defenses.	O	O
Security Council members were discussing a French-drafted resolution that demands a ceasefire in Aleppo.	O	O
Fox News saw an initial draft of the resolution which called for the suspension of all aerial military activity over the war-torn city.	O	O
The measure also called for the delivery of humanitarian aid and the establishment of a mechanism to monitor the ceasefire.	O	O
Russia’s Ambassador to the U.N., Vitaly Churkin, said earlier this week that the resolution in its current form “has no chance of working,” essentially threatening to veto it.	B	UN Resolution
Moscow’s deployment of advanced air defenses in Syria is viewed by Western diplomats as a move that would deter any attempt by the West to impose a no-fly zone over Syria, a long-standing appeal by Syria’s opposition.	O	O
The UN Security Council scheduled to vote on the resolution at 3pm Saturday.	O	O
Churkin, said a short time ago outside the Security Council that “the French draft contains elements that we think are harmful,” hinting of Moscow’s intention to veto.	B	Resolution

Syrian peace talks back on
Syrian peace talks back onRussia announced it would hold Syria ceasefire talks with the United States and regional powers this weekend - the first meeting since Washington froze bilateral negotiations after an intensified onslaught was launched on the city.	O	O
In a statement released on Wednesday, Russia said Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry had agreed to hold talks aimed at "creating the conditions for the resolution of the Syrian crisis" in Lausanne, Switzerland on Saturday, alongside top diplomats from "key countries in the region".	O	O
In an interview with a US broadcaster, Lavrov said the talks would include Turkey, Saudi Arabia and possibly Qatar.	O	O
"We would like to have a meeting in this narrow format, to have a businesslike discussion, not another General Assembly-like debate," he said.	O	O
A US State Department source confirmed the meeting to AFP news agency.	O	O
The annoucement came as Syrian and Russian warplanes pounded rebel-held Aleppo.	O	O
Medical sources said more than 80 people had been killed in the barrage.	O	O
The new discussions come as tensions between Moscow and the West have spiked over the five-year Syrian conflict, after peace efforts unravelled and the intense bombing campaign was unleashed on war-ravaged Aleppo.	O	O
"Obviously the missing components are the opposition … or anyone representing the government in Damascus," Al Jazeera's Rory Challands reported from Moscow.	O	O
"The opposition will most likely decry this as a great power powwow and won't approve.	O	O
"International aid groups and UN agencies have appealed for a halt to the violence to allow relief supplies in.	O	O
No assistance has entered Aleppo since July, while hospitals and rescue vehicles have all come under attack.	O	O
Over the weekend, Russia blocked a UN Security Council resolution proposed by France and Spain on ending the hostilities in the war-torn country, blaming Paris for the refusal to discuss a compromise version.	O	O
Russia's veto prompted French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault to call on the International Criminal Court to investigate Russia for possible war crimes in Syria.	B	Russia
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said his diplomats had made it clear they wanted the resolution amended, and the only reason for France to push it through was "to exacerbate the situation and whip up an anti-Russia hysteria".	O	O
Western governments said the veto showed Moscow had no interest in halting the violence.	O	O

U.N. calls assault on Aleppo possible war crime as deaths mount
The United States said Monday it was suspending "bilateral" talks with Russia on trying to end the violence in war-torn Syria and claimed Moscow has not lived up to its terms of agreement last month to restore the cease-fire. which has killed more than 400 people and injured hundreds more over the last two weeks — may constitute a war crime and should be referred to the International Criminal Court.	B	Russia
The statement came as Russia announced it has deployed an advanced anti-aircraft missile system to Syria, and warned the U.S. against attacking its ally.	O	O
A referral to the International Criminal Court "would be more than justified given the rampant and deeply shocking impunity that has characterized the conflict and the magnitude of the crimes that have been committed, some of which may indeed amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity," Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, the U.N.'s high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement.	O	O
The commissioner called for a change in U.N. rules that allow permanent members of the Security Council to veto referrals to the International Criminal Court.	O	O
The permanent members are the United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom.	O	O
Zeid warned Russia against using incendiary weapons in Aleppo, and said world leaders should “limit the use of the veto by the permanent members of the Security Council,” which would allow the U.N. body to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.	B	Russia

USA TODAYA cease-fire brokered by the U.S. and Russia collapsed on Sept. 19 as fighting has continued in Syria.	O	O
Russia on Tuesday said it deployed its advanced S-300 anti-aircraft missile system to Syria, amid warnings against attacks on Syrian forces.	O	O
The Syrian Arab Republic received an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system,” said Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, according to state-owned broadcaster RT.	O	O
“This system is designed to ensure the safety of the naval base in [Syrian city of] Tartus and ships located in the coastal area” of Syria, he said.	O	O
On Oct. 1, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned against “direct aggression” by the U.S. against Damascus and the Syrian army.	O	O
Such U.S. aggression “would cause a terrible tectonic shift not only in the country, but in the entire region,” Zakharova said.	O	O
Of the 1,400 killed or wounded since the ceasefire collapsed, 425 were dead, including 293 non-combatants, according to the monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Tuesday.	O	O
The London-based monitoring agency's numbers could not be independently verified.	O	O
The killings resulted from airstrikes conducted by Russia and the Syrian government, which targeted homes and hospitals in civilian areas, the observatory said.	O	O
The onslaught against civilians is aimed at forcing them to flee to government-controlled parts of the city, the observatory said.	O	O
Dozens of people were killed Tuesday as Syrian rebels fought both the Islamic State and government forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad, the observatory reported.	O	O
A three-way battle continued in Damascus province between opposition forces and the Islamic State, which launched an offensive in the area and killed three rebels in a suicide attack, the Observatory reported.	O	O
In separate fighting, four government soldiers were captured by al-Qaeda’s Syrian franchise, formerly known as the Nusra Front, which is allied with some opposition forces.	O	O
In Hama province, six government soldiers and an unknown number of opposition fighters were killed in a rebel offensive.	O	O

Notably absent will be Russia.	O	O
The U.S suspended bilateral talks with Russia about Syria on Monday, citing that country’s ongoing airstrikes in Aleppo despite a cease-fire agreement.	O	O
The cease-fire, which began Sept. 12, was rocky from the start, but collapsed a week later when an airstrike that the U.S. blamed on Russia hit a United Nations aid convoy in Aleppo, killing 20 people.	O	O
“Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course, inconsistent with the (cease-fire), as demonstrated by their intensified attacks against civilian areas, targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need,” State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.	B	Russia
The U.S. administration is not giving up on finding a political solution.	O	O
But any further cease-fire arrangements with Russia would have to include an end to Russian attacks on "civilian populations" and the grounding of Syrian President Bashar Assad's air force, Mark Toner, a deputy spokesman for the State Department, told reporters Wednesday.	O	O
Officials from the U.S. and Russian militaries, which are both conducting airstrikes in Syria, will continue to consult with each other to ensure their air operations do not conflict, but the U.S. is now considering other options in Syria, deputy spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said Monday.	O	O
President Obama’s National Security Council is considering various options to press Russia and the Syrian government to stop their offensives and return to the negotiating table.	O	O

Russia vetoes UN resolution to halt Aleppo bombing
UNITED NATIONS – Rival resolutions on Syria backed by the West and Russia were defeated in the U.N.	O	O
Security Council on Saturday, offering no relief to the besieged city of Aleppo and leaving the key powers even more divided over a course of action in the war-ravaged country.	O	O
Russia vetoed a French-drafted resolution demanding an immediate halt to the bombing campaign that the Syrian government and Russia are carrying out against rebel-held districts in Aleppo.	O	O
The rival Russian draft which made no mention of a bombing halt was rejected because it failed to get the minimum nine "yes" votes needed for approval by the 15-member council.	O	O
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, the current rotating council president, said before the votes that members were engaging in "one of the strangest spectacles" in the Security Council, because they were meeting knowing that neither resolution would be adopted.	B	UN Resolution on Aleppo Truce
"This waste of time is inadmissible," he said.	I	UN Resolution on Aleppo Truce
The votes reflected the deep divisions in the U.N.'s most powerful body which is charged with ensuring international peace and security but has totally failed to take action to end the more than 5-year Syrian conflict which has killed over 300,000 people and displaced millions.	B	UN
The French-backed resolution received 11 "yes" votes, two "no" votes from Russia and Venezuela, and abstentions from China and Angola.	O	O
The Russian resolution received four "yes" votes, nine "no" votes, and two abstentions.	O	O
It was the fifth veto by Russia of a Western-backed resolution aimed at ending the Syrian conflict.	O	O
When Syria's U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari started speaking after the votes, a number of ambassadors walked out, including the representatives of Britain, France, Ukraine and the United States.	O	O
French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, who addressed the session before the vote on the French resolution, warned that the continued bombing of Aleppo was killing civilians and destroying hospitals and schools — "and has nothing to do with combatting terrorism," as Syrian President Bashar Assad's government and its close ally Russia contend.	O	O
"It is the annihilation of Aleppo," he said, declaring that the continued bombing will leave the city in ruins, a place where citizens will be left to their "executioners.	B	Aleppo
"He compared Aleppo's likely fate to Guernica during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s, Srebrenica during the Bosnian war and the Chechen capital Grozny which was pummeled by the Russian army in the mid-1990s.	I	Aleppo
Russia's Churkin said the demand for a bombing halt in Aleppo was "not fleshed out" and would affect the government-controlled western part of the city as well as the rebel-held east.	O	O
He said the French resolution's adoption would have been the first where the Security Council decided on a course of action for a permanent council member without prior agreement — meaning that Russia would have been required to stop all flights and bombing of Aleppo.	O	O
Churkin noted that activity in Aleppo had gone down on Friday and "we hope this is a trend that will continue.	O	O
"Until Friday afternoon, the French resolution was the only one before the council.	O	O
But Russia unexpectedly introduced a rival resolution in a bid take some attention off its expected veto.	O	O
After the council rejected the Russian draft, Britain's U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft addressed Churkin directly saying: "A lonely veto and then just four votes in favor of your text — a double humiliation.	O	O
""This text was a cynical attempt to divert attention from your veto today that once again denied any hope to the people of Aleppo," Rycroft said.	B	Resolution
"It's a sham, just as Russia's hollow commitment to a political process in Syria is a sham.	O	O
"U.S. deputy ambassador David Pressman followed up saying Russia and Syria will undoubtedly claim that any devastation in Aleppo that "they are raining down is directed at terrorists," not at the civilian buildings they are clearly striking.	O	O
"What Russia wants is for there to be more talk while they seek to take the city by brutal force," Pressman said.	B	Russia
"What we want is less talk and more action for them to stop the slaughter.	I	Russia
"Russia's Churkin said he wouldn't react to the "provocative rhetoric" from the U.S. and Britain.	O	O
He agreed that "more action is needed," but blamed the United States for failing to separate the moderate opposition from the extremists as called for in the failed U.S.-Russia cease-fire agreement.	O	O
Both the French and the Russian resolutions urged immediate implementation of that agreement and "immediate, safe and unhindered humanitarian access throughout Syria.	O	O
"Many council members expressed dismay at the council's continued failure to end the suffering of the Syrian people.	O	O
"Instead of holding serious political consultations in its open and closed sessions to stop the Syrian bloodletting, consultations have amounted to no more than repetition of traditional positions and a dialogue of the deaf," said Egypt's U.N. Ambassador Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta, the Arab representative on the council.	O	O

Mr Johnson said hospitals and other civilian targets had been deliberately targeted
Mr Johnson said hospitals and other civilian targets had been deliberately targetedThe US should be as much a target for protests against the violence in Syria as Russia, a spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has suggested.	O	O
He told journalists that a number of foreign powers, including the UK, were involved in the brutal conflict and Russia should not be singled out.	B	Russia
While condemning Russian "atrocities", he said civilians had also been killed by the US-led coalition's bombings.	O	O
One Labour MP said the comments were "unworthy of the party".	O	O
The row came as Russia reacted angrily to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's call for protests outside its UK embassy.	O	O
In a Commons debate on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the evidence pointed to Russia being behind a fatal attack on an aid convoy in Aleppo and called for the International Criminal Court to investigate this and other possible war crimes.	B	Russia
He questioned why the Stop The War coalition - of which Mr Corbyn is a long-time supporter - and other anti-war groups were not making their feelings known outside the Russian embassy in London, saying Russia risked becoming an international pariah if it continued with its military campaign in support of President Assad.	O	O
Responding to Mr Johnson's comments, a Labour spokesman said talks aimed at securing a lasting ceasefire and political settlement in Syria were preferable to demonstrations.	O	O
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson asks: "Where is the Stop The War coalition at the moment.	O	O
Where are they.	O	O
"Asked whether Mr Corbyn backed demonstrations against Russia, he added: "Obviously, people are entitled and at complete liberty to demonstrate outside not only the Russian embassy, but all the other embassies of those intervening powers.	O	O
"People are free to protest outside the intervening powers' embassies and there are a number of them - not just the US and Russia.	O	O
"There are multiple foreign interventions in the Syrian civil war and we've emphasised that there needs to be an end to that and those powers need to be part of a negotiated settlement, which is the only way to stop the conflict.	O	O
"'Diverting attention'Asked whether he was suggesting a moral equivalence between US and UK actions against so-called Islamic State and Moscow's support for the Assad regime, the spokesman said he was not "in the business of allocating blame".	O	O
But he added: "The focus on Russian atrocities or Syrian army atrocities - which is absolutely correct - sometimes diverts attention from other atrocities that are taking place.	O	O
"Independent assessments are that there have been very large-scale civilian casualties as a result of the US-led coalition bombing.	O	O
"There are several cases of large numbers of civilian deaths in single attacks, and there hasn't been so much attention on those atrocities or those casualties.	O	O
"Mr Corbyn, he added, had opposed Russian intervention in the five-year conflict from the start - as he had the UK's extension of bombing raids from Iraq to Syria last year.	O	O
"The intervention of foreign powers in the conflict has no doubt escalated and fuelled it throughout," he added.'Unworthy'Downing Street dismissed any comparison between Russian bombing and UK military operations in Syria, saying its strategy was based on minimising civilian casualties.	O	O
"We are working towards peace, towards finding a solution and towards alleviating the humanitarian suffering of the Syrian people," a No 10 spokeswoman said.	O	O
"I think very clearly by the fact we were sponsoring a UN Security Council resolution that calls for the end of the bombardment of the people of Aleppo and Russia vetoed that resolution, that's quite a contrast in positions.	O	O
"Labour MP John Woodcock, a long-term critic of Mr Corbyn, rejected suggestions that the US was as culpable as Russia for attacks on Syrian civilians and the virtual destruction of Aleppo, once the country's largest city.	O	O
"This absurdity seems like a deliberate provocation, unworthy of our leader and our party," he said.	O	O
And Brendan Cox, whose wife, Labour MP Jo Cox, was co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Syria before she was killed in June, said the comment was "absolutely disgraceful".	O	O

Syria: UK wants ICC probe of alleged Russian war crimes
Syria: UK wants ICC probe of alleged Russian war crimesBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has given his backing to French calls for an International Criminal Court investigation into alleged Russian war crimes in the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo.	B	Russia
Johnson made the comments on Tuesday as the lower house of the British parliament met for an emergency debate on the situation in the rebel-held east of the city.	O	O
The minister said there was little doubt the targeting of civilian structures in Aleppo, such as hospitals, was intentional and, therefore, against international law.	O	O
"Hospitals have been targeted with such frequency and precision that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this must be deliberate policy.	O	O
We do think there could be advantage in the ICC procedures," Johnson said.	O	O
"I would remind this house that in recent history war criminals have been prosecuted decades after the offences.	O	O
"Air strikes in Aleppo on Tuesday in the Bustan and Ferdous neighbourhoods killed at least 43 people, with the death toll likely to go up as rescuers work through the rubble.	O	O
At least two of those killed were children and strikes were ongoing at the time of publication.	O	O
In a statement released on Tuesday, the Russian Embassy in London denied targeting civilians and criticised the UK and other Western states for their conduct in the five-year war, which has killed an estimated 400,000 people.	O	O
"Britain's logic implies putting an end to fighting terrorists and their allies.	O	O
Our logic is different - fight on to destroy the jihadists sparing the civilians.	O	O
"Syria is going through the hard process of defeating terrorists.	O	O
Pity that the British parliamentarians placed themselves on the wrong side of history this time," it said.	O	O
Johnson's comments came after Conservative MP and former minister Andrew Mitchell compared Russia to Nazi Germany before World War II.	O	O
"[Russia] is behaving like a rogue elephant, shredding international humanitarian law, abusing its veto powers on the UN Security Council, using the veto to protect itself from its own war crimes," Mitchell said.	B	Russia
"The Russians are not attacking military formations, they are not engaging with militias and fighters, they are attacking hospitals and a terrified population.	I	Russia
"The Russians are doing to the UN precisely what Italy and Germany did to the League of Nations in the 1930s, and they are doing to Aleppo precisely what the Nazis did to Guernica during the Spanish Civil War.	I	Russia

Russia vetoes UN resolution to stop bombing of Aleppo
Russia vetoed a UN resolution aimed at stopping the bombing of Aleppo on Saturday, prolonging the division and paralysis of the security council in the face of the Syria’s humanitarian disaster.	B	UN
The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, currently presiding over the security council, cast the veto against a Franco-Spanish resolution that had demanded an end to all aerial bombardment and overflights of Aleppo by Russian and Syrian regime aircraft.	O	O
The resolution also called for a resumed ceasefire and the delivery of humanitarian supplies to besieged population.	O	O
Russia and Syria must face war crimes investigations, says John Kerry	O	O
China abstained, further isolating Russia on the issue, along with Angola.	O	O
Venezuela was the only other country to vote with Russia against the resolution.	O	O
A Russian counter-resolution, which omitted mention of aerial bombardment, was voted down with nine votes against and four in favour.	O	O
The bitter divisions in the council, which faces a high and rapidly rising death toll in eastern Aleppo, produced a heated but fruitless debate that saw some of the normal diplomatic niceties abandoned.	O	O
“Normally I begin my statement with, ‘Thank you Mr President’,” Matthew Rycroft, the UK ambassador to the UN, said at the start of his remarks.	O	O
“I cannot do this today.	O	O
”“This council cannot stand by while such misery is meted out on the people of Aleppo.	B	UN
And yet, thanks to you, Mr President, that is exactly what we are doing,” Rycroft told the council.	O	O
“Thanks to your actions today, Syrians will continue to lose their lives in Aleppo and beyond to Russian and Syrian bombing.	O	O
Please stop now.	O	O
”The US deputy ambassador, David Pressman, said: “One of us, perversely the president of council, is determined for the killing to continue, and is helping carry it out.	B	Russia
”There are about 275,000 people trapped by the siege of eastern Aleppo, where civilians are suffering through daily bombing, including by bunker-buster and incendiary weapons, and through starvation, as limited supplies run out and aid convoys are blocked from the city.	O	O
John Kerry, the US secretary of state, on Friday called for a war crimes investigation of the Russian and Syrian regime bombing.	B	Russia
The Russian foreign ministry said the Franco-Spanish resolution “distorted” the real situation in Syria, and that a ban on aerial bombardment would “provide cover to terrorists from Jabhat al-Nusra” and allied militants.	B	UN Resolution on Aleppo Truce
The White Helmets leader: ‘We can anticipate the scale of destruction based on the sound of the plane’	O	O
According to diplomats, the UN envoy on Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the security council that the presence of roughly 1,000 Nusra fighters was being used as a pretext for the bombing of 275,000 people and had offered to personally escort the militant group out of the city to guarantee their safe passage.	O	O
At the present rate of bombardment of eastern Aleppo, De Mistura said the city would be totally destroyed by December.	B	Aleppo
The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, called it “worse than a slaughterhouse”.	O	O
UN: eastern Aleppo could be destroyed by Christmas – video “Russia has once again abused its veto privilege and sabotaged the UN security council, this time stonewalling efforts to stop the vicious assault on east Aleppo’s civilians,” said Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch.	B	Russia
“Today’s vote is a stark reminder of the urgent need for permanent members of the security council to shelve the veto in situations of mass atrocities, an idea supported by a vast majority of countries around the world.	B	Vetoes
The ball is now in the court of the UN general assembly, which should feel compelled to hold an emergency meeting, demand an end to unlawful attacks on civilians in Aleppo, 100,000 of whom are children, and explore avenues for accountability.”.	B	UN

France to seek ICC options for war crimes investigation in Aleppo
France is working to find a way for the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor to launch an investigation into war crimes it says have been committed by Syrian and Russian forces in eastern Aleppo, Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said on Monday.	B	Russia
A boy walks past damaged buildings in the northern Syrian rebel-held town of al-Waqf, in Aleppo Governorate, Syria, October 9, 2016.	O	O
REUTERS/Khalil AshawiSince the collapse of efforts to reach a ceasefire in September, Russian and Syrian warplanes have launched their biggest offensive on Aleppo’s besieged rebel-held sectors, in a battle that could become a turning point in the five-year-old civil war.	O	O
“These bombings - and I said it in Moscow - are war crimes,” Ayrault told France Inter radio after a French-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution on Syria was vetoed at the weekend by Russia.	O	O
“It includes all those who are complicit for what’s happening in Aleppo, including Russian leaders.	O	O
“We shall contact the International Criminal Court prosecutor to see how she can launch these investigations.	O	O
”U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also called for a war crimes investigation last week.	O	O
It is unclear how the ICC could proceed given that the court has no jurisdiction for crimes in Syria because it is not a member of the ICC.	O	O
It appears the only way for the case to make it to the ICC would be through the U.N.	O	O
Security Council referral, which has been deadlocked over Syria.	O	O
Moscow vetoed a French resolution in May 2014 to refer the situation in Syria to the ICC.	O	O
“It is very dangerous to play with such words because war crimes also weigh on the shoulders of American officials,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, according to RIA news agency.	O	O
ICC OPTIONS A French diplomatic source acknowledged the difficulties, but said Paris had begun to comb through the ICC’s articles to see what could be done.	O	O
The source said the ICC would have jurisdiction if an alleged criminal had the citizenship of an ICC member, for example a dual Syrian-French national in the government involved in an attack.	O	O
It would be the job of the relevant member state to bring a prosecution.	O	O
The source said it would also study whether the ICC could have jurisdiction if a victim of an attack had citizenship of an ICC member.	O	O
“It will be complicated, but we are looking for other solutions.	O	O
Our jurists are trying to find other ways,” the source said, adding that Paris was also not ruling out a new Security Council resolution on accountability.	O	O
Ayrault said Paris would also seek separate sanctions on the Syrian government at the United Nations once a joint U.N. and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inquiry concludes on Oct. 21.	O	O
The inquiry has identified two Syrian Air Force helicopter squadrons and two other military units it holds responsible for chlorine gas attacks on civilians, Western diplomats have told Reuters.	O	O
The diplomatic source said a U.S.-drafted Security Council resolution on the use of chemical weapons would now be discussed, although it was vital to reach a deal with Russia.	O	O
“It would be problematic to have a veto on chemical weapons.	O	O
It would be serious, but until now the Russians have been on board with regard chemical weapons,” the source said.	B	Russia
French officials have grappled for ways to try to put new pressure on Russia and their growing anger at events in Aleppo have led them to reconsider whether to host him on Oct. 19.	O	O
“We do not agree with what Russia is doing, bombarding Aleppo.	O	O
France is committed as never before to saving the population of Aleppo,” Ayrault said.	O	O
“If the President decides (to see Putin), this will not be to trade pleasantries,” he added.	O	O

U.N. council to vote on rival Syria resolutions on Saturday
The United Nations Security Council will vote on Saturday on rival draft resolutions on Syria - a French text requiring an end to air strikes and military flights over Aleppo city and a Russian text that is similar but does not include that demand.	O	O
The French draft resolution appears doomed to be vetoed by Russia.	B	Resolution
Moscow’s text is effectively the French draft with Russian amendments that put the focus back on a failed Sept. 9 U.S.	O	O
/Russia ceasefire deal, which is annexed to the draft.	O	O
“This is a cynical attempt to divert attention away from the bombing of Aleppo,” British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said of the Russian draft.	B	Resolution
The 15-member council has been negotiating for a week on a French text.	O	O
A Saturday vote on that was called after French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault visited Moscow on Thursday and Washington on Friday to discuss the resolution.	O	O
Moscow then proposed its own draft and said it would be put to a vote immediately after the vote on the French draft, which is likely to be blocked by Russia because it “demands that all parties immediately end all aerial bombardments of and military flights over Aleppo city.	B	Resolution
”Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, backed by Russian war planes and Iranian support, have been battling to capture eastern Aleppo, the rebel-held half of Syria’s largest city, where more than 250,000 civilians are trapped.	O	O
“This is not a draft which is right for adoption, I have this suspicion that the real motive is to cause a Russian veto,” said Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin on Friday of the French text.	B	Resolution
“I cannot possibly see how we can let this resolution pass.	I	Resolution
”Security Council diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while the Russian draft contained a lot of reasonable language, the lack of any references to ending air strikes on Aleppo was likely to be a problem.	O	O
A resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes to be adopted.	O	O
The council veto powers are the United States, France, Britain, Russia and China.	O	O
The United States on Monday suspended talks with Russia on implementing a ceasefire deal in Syria, accusing Moscow of not living up to its commitments to halt fighting and ensure aid reached besieged communities.	O	O
That failed ceasefire deal is annexed to the Russian draft U.N. resolution, which urges Moscow and Washington to ensure the implementation of the agreement.	O	O
It stresses an “urgent need to achieve and verify separating moderate opposition forces from ‘Jabhat Al-Nusra’ as a key priority.	O	O
”Both the French and Russian drafts, seen by Reuters, urge an immediate cessation of hostilities and safe and unhindered humanitarian aid access in Syria.	O	O
The French draft asks U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon to propose options for a U.N.-supervised monitoring of a truce and threatens to “take further measures” in the event of non-compliance by “any party to the Syrian domestic conflict.	O	O
”Ayrault said that he planned to go to New York for the vote and told reporters in Washington: “I still have hope that the resolution will pass and that it can be implemented.	O	O
”Russia and China have previously protected the Syrian government from council action by blocking several resolutions, including a bid to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.	O	O
“It is unprecedented for the members of the council to ask a permanent member to limit its own activities,” Churkin said of the French draft resolution.	O	O
“I’m supposed to vote for a demand that then our military will have to comply with.	O	O
It doesn’t mean that certain things cannot happen but they can’t happen through a certain process, which is definitely not putting a resolution with this kind of text on the table,” he said.	O	O
A crackdown by Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 sparked a civil war and Islamic State militants have used the chaos to seize territory in Syria and Iraq.	O	O

The right of veto in the UN Security Council serves as a cornerstone of global security ensuring that the US and its allies cannot abuse their majority to rubberstamp resolutions on a grand scale, Russia’s UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin said.	O	O
There is an ongoing discussion about potential Security Council reform, including the issue of the veto right, or the UN Charter’s requirement for the SC Permanent Members’ unanimity.	O	O
It remains the cornerstone of the checks and balances system, which was created to guard peace and security after WWII.	O	O
Russia to support UNSC reform if backed by over 2/3 of member states – Foreign MinistryWhile Moscow supports the reform, in order to make the UNSC more effective and representative, it refuses to relinquish its veto right, which may result in the deterioration of global security, Churkin told Russia’s Chanel One.	O	O
“In the world that we live in, the US and its allies almost always have nine votes in favor of one resolution or another.	O	O
Therefore, without the veto right, they could just put a resolution on the table and go on rubber-stamping these resolutions,” Churkin said.	O	O
Earlier in the day, giving his assessment of the diplomatic rift at the UN Security Council, Churkin said that the tensions between the US and Russia are at a 40 year high.	O	O
“The general situation I think is pretty bad at this point, probably the worst … since 1973,” he said in an interview with three US journalists at Russia’s UN Mission in New York.	O	O
The Russian Ambassador was referring the Yom Kippur War, also known as the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, that was led by Egypt and Syria against Israel from October 6 to 25, 1973.	O	O
The war theater engulfed the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights – territories that had been occupied by Israel since the Six Day War of 1967.	O	O
The envoy blamed a “lack of respect and lack of in-depth discussions” for the current tensions, as he outlined some of the crucial points that led to the ongoing standoff between the world’s biggest nuclear powers.	O	O
UNSC veto right is crucial balance tool to avoid ‘disasters’ – Russia’s envoy ChurkinFirst of all, Churkin reiterated that the US and NATO disregarded Moscow’s concerns when the alliance started fortifying their security close to Russian borders “at the expense of Russia”.	O	O
Churkin added that one of “the greatest provocations” was the 2008 NATO summit, where the alliance decided that Ukraine and Georgia should eventually become NATO members.	O	O
The ambassador stressed that in addition to NATO’s expansion, Washington pulled out from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) under George W.	O	O
Bush administration in 2001.	O	O
Signed in 1972 by Washington and Moscow to slow the nuclear arms race, the ABM Treaty barred both superpowers from deploying national defenses against long-range ballistic missiles.	O	O
The treaty was based on the premise that if either superpower constructed a strategic defense, the other would build up its offensive nuclear forces to offset the defense, resulting in a never-ending arms race.	O	O
But the pivotal point was reached with the eruption of conflict in Ukraine following the coup, which was supported by the US, and then blamed on Russia to justify the introduction of sanctions against Moscow, Churkin said.	O	O
In the latest “string of events” the US military struck Syrian army positions, and somewhat baselessly said that Moscow and Damascus had conducted a retaliatory attack on a UN aid convoy.	O	O
Subsequently, the ceasefire deal with Russia evaporated.	O	O
‘US has been veto champion in UN for decades’ – Chomsky to RTThe collapse of the ceasefire deal in Syria came to be the latest in a series of events that aggravated US-Russia relations, according to Churkin.	O	O
Washington accused Moscow of escalating violence in Aleppo amid its own increasingly apparent failure to separate the so-called moderates from terrorists.	O	O
“[In February], CIA Director [John] Brennan in Moscow said it would take them two to three weeks to separate the moderate opposition from [al-]Nusra Front.	O	O
It never happened.	O	O
So my understanding is that they are not controlling the moderate opposition and they are not controlling the local countries who support the moderate opposition.	O	O
This is a huge problem.	O	O
”Churkin gave the interview as the international talks on Syria in Switzerland's Lausanne kicked off behind closed doors.	O	O
While no breakthrough has been reached, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that “some ideas” discussed in Switzerland “might affect the situation.	O	O
”Representatives from nine countries took part in Saturday’s talks at Lausanne’s luxury Beau-Rivage hotel.	O	O
Middle Eastern regional powers were represented by Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, UAE and Turkey.	O	O
The UN special envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura was also present at the talks.	O	O

The attack on a UN humanitarian aid convoy near the Syrian city of Aleppo last month, which Washington has blamed on Russia, was actually carried out by one of the terrorist groups present in the area, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said.	B	Russia
“It was one of the terrorist groups.	O	O

France has announced it will ask the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate possible war crimes committed in Syrian city of Aleppo.	O	O
Rebel-held eastern Aleppo city, besieged since early September, has been the focus of an intense aerial bombardment campaign by Russian and Syrian fighter jets.	O	O
For their part, anti-government fighters are trying to break the siege and connect with other rebel-held territories to the west of Aleppo, Syria's second city.	O	O
"We do not agree with what Russia is doing, bombarding Aleppo.	O	O
France is committed as never before to saving the population of Aleppo," Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French foreign minister, told France's Inter radio on Monday.	O	O
He said President Francois Hollande will take into account the situation in Aleppo when deciding whether to see his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin when the latter visits Paris on October 19.	O	O
"If the president decides [to see Putin], this will not be to trade pleasantries," Ayrault said.	O	O
Russian-backed Syrian forces have made significant advances in their renewed two-week-old offensive in Aleppo, seizing territory to the north and pushing back the front line in the city centre.	O	O
However, the southern Sheikh Said district fell on Monday to a coalition of rebel groups after they overpowered a foreign pro-government armed group attempting to hold it.	O	O
A rebel source told Al Jazeera that more than 20 pro-government fighters from an Iraqi militia - as well as four opposition activists being held captive by them - were killed in the clashes.	O	O
The source said opposition groups also suffered casualties but would not give a precise number.	O	O
Carnage in AleppoSince the beginning of the Syrian military offensive on September 22, a few days after a joint US-Russia-brokered ceasefire collapsed, at least 290 people - mostly civilians - have been killed in Aleppo's rebel-held areas, 57 of them children, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.	O	O
Another 50 civilians, including nine children, have been killed in rebel shelling of government-held areas of the city, according to the Britain-based monitoring group, which relies on a network of sources on the ground in Syria.	O	O
On Saturday Russia vetoed a French-drafted resolution that would have demanded an immediate end to air strikes and military flights over Aleppo, and for a truce along with humanitarian aid access throughout Syria.	O	O
A rival Russia-backed resolution also failed to pass.	O	O
In what offered a glimmer of hope, though, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced during a bilateral meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Istanbul on Monday that the two countries had agreed to intensify military contacts and cooperate on delivering aid to Aleppo.	O	O
Against this background, Russia announced on Monday the creation of a permanent military base in Syria.	O	O
The move, announced by Nikolai Pankov, the country's deputy defence minister, indicates that Russia is building up its capabilities in Syria despite a partial drawdown in March.	O	O
"By doing this Russia is not only increasing its military potential in Syria but in the entire Middle East," Senator Igor Morozov, a member of the upper house of parliament's International Affairs Committee, told the RIA news agency.	O	O

Syrian government, allies advance as Russia vetoes U.N. demand
Russia vetoed a French-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution on Saturday that would have demanded an immediate end to air strikes and military flights over Syria’s Aleppo city and called for a truce and humanitarian aid access throughout Syria.	O	O
Satellite dishes damaged by Islamic State militants are pictured inside a mosque in Turkman Bareh village, after rebel fighters advanced in the area, in northern Aleppo Governorate, Syria, October 7, 2016.	O	O
REUTERS/Khalil AshawiMeanwhile, a rival Russian-drafted resolution that aimed to revive a failed Sept. 9 U.S. and Russia ceasefire deal on Syria did not garner the minimum nine votes.	O	O
Fighting continued in the almost six-year conflict with Syrian government forces recapturing territory from insurgents in several western areas.	O	O
President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, backed by Russian air power and Iranian, Lebanese and Iraqi fighters on the ground, hold the upper hand around the key battleground of Aleppo, whose opposition-held eastern sector has been encircled for all but a short period since July.	O	O
The government side’s bombardment of Aleppo since a ceasefire brokered by Washington and Moscow in September collapsed after a week has drawn condemnation from the United Nations and countries supporting the Syrian opposition.	O	O
France, which opposes Assad, demanded in its draft resolution an end to air strikes and military flights over Aleppo city.	O	O
Russia has backed Assad with a year-long air campaign against the rebels.	O	O
French President Francois Hollande on Saturday had urged United Nations Security Council members not to use their veto against a resolution that calls for an end to bombardments of Aleppo.	O	O
Russia’s draft, which does not include that demand, urges Moscow and Washington to revive the ceasefire deal.	O	O
Syrian opposition negotiator Asaad al-Zoubi said on his Twitter account that its High Negotiations Committee would not accept any new ceasefire deal without guaranteed monitoring of it by European and Arab countries.	O	O
Rebels also suffered setbacks further northeast near the Turkish border on Saturday, in fighting against Islamic State militants, British-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.	O	O
Syrian government forces and their allies, backed by air raids, took over an area on Aleppo’s northern outskirts on Saturday, state media and the Observatory said.	O	O
The advance in the Awaija area strengthened their hold on areas surrounding rebel-held east Aleppo, the Observatory said.	O	O
Rebel official Zakaria Malahifji of the Aleppo-based Fastaqim faction denied there had been a government advance there.	O	O
But he did confirm government advances further south in Hama province, reported by pro-Damascus media and the Observatory.	O	O
The Syrian army and its allies recaptured several towns and villages from rebels in Hama’s northern countryside, reversing recent insurgent gains in the area.	O	O
Rebels had seized towns and villages north of Hama city after launching an offensive at the end of August in rare advances while insurgent factions were pressed elsewhere.	O	O
The government’s Hama advances were their first in the area since then, the Observatory said.	O	O
It said the government side had taken advantage of recent infighting between two Islamist insurgent groups in the countryside of Idlib, north of Hama’s provincial boundary.	O	O
In a separate government advance against insurgents near Damascus, the Syrian army and allied forces seized a large portion of the town of al-Hameh to the northwest of the Syrian capital, the Observatory said.	O	O
ISLAMIC STATE ADVANCES Russia’s air power has been crucial for strengthening Assad’s position in the past year, pounding rebels including foreign-backed factions.	O	O
Washington accuses Moscow and Damascus of war crimes for intentionally targeting civilians, aid deliveries and hospitals which have been hit particularly around Aleppo in recent weeks.	O	O
Moscow and Damascus say they are targeting terrorist groups.	O	O
The ceasefire deal brokered by Washington and Moscow in September was meant to pave the way for joint U.S.-Russian targeting of extremists including al Qaeda and Islamic State.	O	O
All sides in the multi-sided Syria conflict, now in its sixth year, are fighting a number of separate battles against IS.	O	O
Members of the jihadist group recaptured several villages from foreign-backed rebels in their counter attack near the Turkish border, the Observatory said.	O	O
The rebels, whom Turkey has supported with tanks and air strikes, had been pushing toward the IS stronghold of Dabiq, a village of symbolic importance to the militants.	O	O
The stiff resistance the insurgents have encountered in recent days shows the challenge they face in capturing Dabiq and flushing the jihadist group out of more areas it controls in northern Syria.	O	O

Two opposing draft resolutions: a French-Spanish version and the other by Russia, on Saturday failed to be approved by the UN Security Council in response to the current situation in Syria.	O	O
The first one, drafted by France and Spain, was vetoed by Russia, a permanent council member, while the Moscow-sponsored draft failed to gain nine votes in favor, the minimum of supporting votes required for a draft to be adopted by the 15-nation UN council, instead gaining nine votes against.	O	O

It was just a political demonstration, if you like.	O	O
""While it wasn't implement -- while we think it could have been -- I'd like to reassure you that very complicated multilateral and bilateral work is ongoing and we do continue to hope that the situation in Syria will go back to normal and this would have a most beneficial affect on the situation in eastern Aleppo and we hope that happens as quickly as possible," he said.

It was another testy session of the council, normally a model of decorum.	O	O
"Normally I begin my statements in this Council with the words 'Thank you, Mr. President.' I cannot do that today," said British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft, opening his remarks after the first resolution failed to be adopted.	O	O
"Because today, we have seen the fifth veto in five years on Syria from you, Mr. President, a veto that has once again stopped this Council from creating the unity needed to give the people of Syria any hope for respite from their suffering, a veto that has once again denigrated the credibility and respect of the Security Council in the eyes of the world," " Rycroft said.

British diplomat gives damning speech over Russian support for Syria before staging walkout at United Nations
The UK’s ambassador to the UN has delivered a damning speech to the Security Council condemning Russia’s actions in the war on Syria, saying the country’s pretensions to peace in the country are a “sham”.	B	Russia
On Saturday Russian representative Vitaly Churkin vetoed a draft resolution written by Spain and France to revive a ceasefire and end air strikes except those against Isis and al-Qaeda affiliated rebels in Syria.	O	O
It marked the fifth time in as many years that Russia has used its position as a permanent member of the Security Council to block UN action in the almost six-year-long civil war.	O	O
Speaking directly to his counterpart, British representative Matthew Rycroft said that Russia’s recent actions in besieged east Aleppo in particular, which is currently suffering from unprecedented Russian-backed shelling by the Syrian regime, exposed “just how hollow Russia’s commitment to the political process is,” calling Russian commitment to diplomacy a “sham”.	B	Russia
“Instead of investing energy in peace and diplomacy, you have instead supported, facilitated and cooperated with the Syrian regime to retake and destroy any areas standing against [Syrian President Bashar] Assad,” Mr Rycroft told the Security Council.	I	Russia
“Killing off, literally, those who want a moderate, peaceful and pluralistic future.	O	O
”Mr Rycroft went on to say that the Russian veto was a “cynical abuse” of power, which “denigrated the credibility and respect of the Security Council in the eyes of the world.	B	Russia
”Mr Churkin put forward a Russian resolution for a ceasefire which did not mention air strikes, which was rejected by several members of the council.	O	O
Around 250,000 civilians remain trapped in rebel-held east Aleppo.	O	O
The UK, US and French delegations to the UN have previously condemned shelling of the area for allegedly deliberately targeting civilian buildings such as hospitals and Syrian civil defence service rescue centres.	O	O
More than 300 people have died because of strikes in recent weeks, the World Health Organisation and several monitors say.	O	O
French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told the Security Council that he will ask the International Court of Justice to investigate whether Russia is guilty of war crimes for its use of particularly brutal cluster munitions, ground-penetrating bombs and white phosphorus on built-up areas in east Aleppo.

France to seek ICC options for war crimes investigation in Aleppo
France is working to find a way for the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor to launch an investigation into war crimes it says have been committed by Syrian and Russian forces in eastern Aleppo, Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said on Monday.	O	O
A boy walks past damaged buildings in the northern Syrian rebel-held town of al-Waqf, in Aleppo Governorate, Syria, October 9, 2016.	O	O
REUTERS/Khalil AshawiSince the collapse of efforts to reach a ceasefire in September, Russian and Syrian warplanes have launched their biggest offensive on Aleppo’s besieged rebel-held sectors, in a battle that could become a turning point in the five-year-old civil war.	O	O
“These bombings - and I said it in Moscow - are war crimes,” Ayrault told France Inter radio after a French-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution on Syria was vetoed at the weekend by Russia.	O	O
“It includes all those who are complicit for what’s happening in Aleppo, including Russian leaders.	O	O
“We shall contact the International Criminal Court prosecutor to see how she can launch these investigations.	O	O
”U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also called for a war crimes investigation last week.	O	O
It is unclear how the ICC could proceed given that the court has no jurisdiction for crimes in Syria because it is not a member of the ICC.	O	O
It appears the only way for the case to make it to the ICC would be through the U.N.	O	O
Security Council referral, which has been deadlocked over Syria.	O	O
Moscow vetoed a French resolution in May 2014 to refer the situation in Syria to the ICC.	O	O
“It is very dangerous to play with such words because war crimes also weigh on the shoulders of American officials,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, according to RIA news agency.	O	O
ICC OPTIONS A French diplomatic source acknowledged the difficulties, but said Paris had begun to comb through the ICC’s articles to see what could be done.	O	O
The source said the ICC would have jurisdiction if an alleged criminal had the citizenship of an ICC member, for example a dual Syrian-French national in the government involved in an attack.	O	O
It would be the job of the relevant member state to bring a prosecution.	O	O
The source said it would also study whether the ICC could have jurisdiction if a victim of an attack had citizenship of an ICC member.	O	O
“It will be complicated, but we are looking for other solutions.	O	O
Our jurists are trying to find other ways,” the source said, adding that Paris was also not ruling out a new Security Council resolution on accountability.	O	O
Ayrault said Paris would also seek separate sanctions on the Syrian government at the United Nations once a joint U.N. and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inquiry concludes on Oct. 21.	O	O
The inquiry has identified two Syrian Air Force helicopter squadrons and two other military units it holds responsible for chlorine gas attacks on civilians, Western diplomats have told Reuters.	O	O
The diplomatic source said a U.S.-drafted Security Council resolution on the use of chemical weapons would now be discussed, although it was vital to reach a deal with Russia.	O	O
“It would be problematic to have a veto on chemical weapons.	O	O
It would be serious, but until now the Russians have been on board with regard chemical weapons,” the source said.	O	O
French officials have grappled for ways to try to put new pressure on Russia and their growing anger at events in Aleppo have led them to reconsider whether to host him on Oct. 19.	O	O
“We do not agree with what Russia is doing, bombarding Aleppo.	O	O
France is committed as never before to saving the population of Aleppo,” Ayrault said.	O	O
“If the President decides (to see Putin), this will not be to trade pleasantries,” he added.	O	O

UK foreign secretary points finger at Russia over bombing
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Tuesday that “all the available evidence” points to Russian responsibility for the bombing of an aid convoy in Syria.	B	Russia
Johnson told the House of Commons that Russia is “in danger of becoming a pariah nation,” and said he would like to see protests outside the Russian embassy against Moscow’s military actions in Syria.	I	Russia
But he did not mention any new action against Moscow, signaling he does not back calls from several lawmakers for a no-fly zone to be enforced over Syria.	O	O
“We cannot do that unless we are prepared to shoot down planes or helicopters that violate that zone, and we need to think very carefully about the consequences,” Johnson said.	O	O
Johnson said “our best hope is to persuade the Russians” to “do the right thing” and back a genuine cease-fire.	O	O
Hundreds have died in aerial attacks on the opposition-held part of Aleppo since the collapse of a short-lived cease-fire last month.	O	O
In one incident, on Sept. 19, at least 18 people died in a strike on a U.N.-backed aid convoy.	O	O
The U.S. blames Russia, but Russia denies responsibility.	O	O
Moscow has been a key backer of President Bashar Assad throughout the Syrian conflict.	O	O
Britain’s Royal Air Force is part of a U.S.-led coalition attacking Islamic State militants in Syria, but in 2013 lawmakers rejected a government plan to launch RAF strikes against Assad’s forces.	O	O
The Russian Embassy in London responded to Johnson’s comments in a tweet, saying Russia’s “record on Syria is thousands of freed villages, thousands of tons of humanitarian aid.	O	O
What’s Britain’s.	O	O
”The recent scenes of civilian suffering in Aleppo prompted Tuesday’s emotional, if inconclusive, emergency debate in Britain’s House of Commons.	O	O

New Zealand pushes to break U.N. Security Council deadlock on Syria
New Zealand gave the 15-member United Nations Security Council on Wednesday a draft resolution that would demand an end to all attacks that may kill civilians in Syria, particularly air strikes in Aleppo, just days after Russia vetoed a similar text.	O	O

Yahoo to Announce Verizon Deal By Tuesday
The Yahoo board has chosen to accept Verizon’s acquisition bid, and Recode reports that competing bidders were informed of the decision Saturday afternoon.	O	O
The news is expected to be made public on Monday, though sources suggested that timeline wasn’t set in stone.	O	O
They did say the parties hoped to make the announcement before Verizon’s Tuesday earnings report.	O	O
Details of the deal are still unknown, but numbers for the acquisition have hovered around $5 billion.	O	O
The acquisition would include Yahoo’s core editorial and search businesses.	O	O
As Matthew Ingram explained earlier in the process, the deal would bolster Verizon’s move into digital advertising, aligning with last year’s $4.4 billion acquisition of AOL.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
Yahoo and AOL (aol, +0.00%) would likely be merged into a unified content and advertising business under Verizon (vz, +0.70%).	B	Yahoo
Recode’s sources suggest that merging will be “very tough,” and that it would likely be managed by AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, with Yahoo’s Marissa Meyer exiting.	O	O
Such a merger would amount to an ignominious coda for two former giants of the first digital gold rush.	O	O
At the time of its 2000 merger with Time-Warner (twx, +0.33%), AOL was valued at over $226 billion, but the company cratered when its subscription model was undermined.	O	O
Similarly, Yahoo’s once-dominant position in a portal-based digital advertising world has dwindled in the face of Google (goog, +0.64%) and Facebook’s (fb, -1.22%) search and social advertising offerings.	B	Yahoo
For more on Yahoo, watch our video:Yahoo’s (YHOO) stock is up slightly in after-hours trading, and has seen gains over the past month despite a mixed-to-disappointing earnings report last week.	O	O

Verizon Will Spend $4.8 Billion to Acquire Yahoo
Yahoo—home to all those email addresses you use for subscriptions you'd rather not have anyone else know about, and the Flickr account you probably haven't updated since 2010—will soon be under the same umbrella as former web 1.0 rival AOL, with Verizon agreeing to acquire the ancient online operation for $4.8 billion.	B	Yahoo
After multiple media outlets reported the acquisition over the weekend, both Verizon and Yahoo confirmed the deal Monday morning.	O	O
"Just over a year ago we acquired AOL to enhance our strategy of providing a cross-screen connection for consumers, creators and advertisers," explains Lowell McAdam, Verizon's chairman and CEO.	O	O
"The acquisition of Yahoo will put Verizon in a highly competitive position as a top global mobile media company, and help accelerate our revenue stream in digital advertising.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
"The Verizon deal will include all of Yahoo's online properties.	O	O
What Big V is not acquiring is Yahoo's more expensive asset—its 15 percent ownership stake in Chinese online retail giant Alibaba and its shares of Yahoo Japan.	O	O
Bloomberg reports that those two pieces alone are currently worth around $40 billion, more than eight times the sale value of Yahoo's online businesses.	O	O
According to The Wall Street Journal, Verizon plans to keep the Yahoo brand intact and seems to believe it can keep much of the existing Yahoo sites and services up and running, continuing to offer an alternative to Google and Microsoft's Bing.	O	O
The notion of Yahoo selling off its namesake e-businesses arose in late 2015, in response to shareholders who proposed the sale as an alternative to the planned spin-off Yahoo's Alibaba stake into its own operation.	O	O
Industry watchers immediately put Verizon at the top of the list of potential buyers, even though the telecom titan had just recently completed a $4.4 billion acquisition of another '90s relic AOL.	O	O
The Yahoo acquisition, much like the AOL deal, is likely intended to boost Verizon's online advertising business.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
Buying Yahoo means you get its huge cache of registration data and email addresses that could be coupled with Verizon's existing consumer data and the targeted advertising tech acquired from AOL.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
At the time, a price tag on Yahoo was placed at around $2 billion to $2.5 billion, but that value has increased significantly in the last nine months.	O	O
In June it was reported that Verizon was willing to pay $3 billion for Yahoo, but an apparent bidding war with AT&T for the company appears to have worked to Yahoo’s benefit, pushing the value to a higher level than the AOL acquisition.	O	O
Of course, the $4.8 billion figure is only around 3.8 percent of Yahoo’s peak market value of $125 billion.	O	O

Verizon's acquisition of Yahoo presents an interesting dilemma for the new owner.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
If Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is fired, her compensation for failing to save the former internet giant will be $54.9 million.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion

It's important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter,” Mayer said in a statement on Monday.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
According to Recode.net, Mayer "would likely go after the deal is officially struck in six to nine months.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
” The New York Times also reported Mayer wouldn’t join Verizon.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
Mayer's contract stipulates she is paid $54.9 million only if both a new owner takes over and she gets fired.	O	O
This happens at the time, when Yahoo is ready for massive layoffs.	O	O
In February, the company announced it would cut its workforce by 15 percent and close offices in five locations.	O	O
Marissa Mayer joined Yahoo as chief executive in 2012 from rival Google.	O	O
She became an instant darling of the media, hailed as the savior of the struggling internet company.	O	O
Mayer had been trying to revive the company’s core media and online advertising business.	O	O
She was criticized for spending funds on various projects that failed to produce any substantial revenue.	O	O
In 2013 Mayer led Yahoo's acquisition of blogging startup Tumblr for $1 billion, promising at the time "not to screw it up".	O	O
The value of the startup has nearly halved since then.	O	O
“The Yahoo way is, ‘We’ll throw 10 rocks against the wall, and maybe one of them will hit the bull’s-eye.	B	Yahoo
’ But you need a sniper rifle in this business,” said analyst Rich Tullo.	I	Yahoo
At the height of the dot-com boom the Silicon Valley web pioneer had a market capitalization of $128 billion.	O	O
Today, Yahoo’s market cap is $36.36 billion.	O	O
On Monday, Verizon announced the acquisition of Yahoo for $4.83 billion.	O	O
The deal has doubled Verizon's digital advertising business, and the buyer got Yahoo's search, mail, and content businesses.	O	O
Yahoo will be merged with Verizon's AOL unit.	O	O
Yahoo is keeping its 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, which have a combined value of $40 billion.	O	O
The company tried to sell its stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant, but abandoned the idea.	O	O

Marissa Mayer's payday: 4 years, $219 million
Marissa Mayer's tumultuous four-year stint as Yahoo's CEO may be coming to a close, but she still has a few giant paychecks left to cash.	O	O
- which is still an uncertainty -- she'll be due about $57 million in severance after Verizon takes over the company, according to Equilar.	O	O
That's expected to happen in the first quarter of 2017.	O	O
Her enormous golden parachute would come on top of more than $162 million in salary and stock awards that Mayer received over the course of her tenure.	O	O
All told, she could exit Yahoo with around $219 million in the bank.	O	O
To receive the severance, of course, she'll have to leave Yahoo (YHOO).	O	O
Though there is wide speculation that she will leave Yahoo when the deal closes, a spokesman for Yahoo said it's "too early to say" whether she will stay on as CEO, accept a new role at Verizon (VZ), or step aside.	O	O
Meanwhile, Mayer says she will stay on to see Yahoo through its transition.	O	O
"For me personally, I'm planning to stay," Mayer wrote Monday in a memo to employees posted on Tumblr.	O	O
"I love Yahoo, and I believe in all of you.	B	Yahoo
It's important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter.	I	Yahoo
"On a conference call with analysts, she was still vague about whether she will join Verizon, saying that she had been "really dedicated to the process of getting to this point.	O	O
"Mayer was a tech celebrity when she became Yahoo's CEO in July 2012, almost exactly four years ago.	O	O
She had been a high-profile executive at Google (GOOGL), joining that company in its infancy.	O	O
She was an incredibly expensive hire	O	O
Yahoo gave her a $30 million signing bonus and $14 million to make whole the Google bonuses she was forgoing at the time.	O	O
With her high pay came soaring expectations to turn around the struggling company, which had gone through years of sinking ad sales and management turmoil.	O	O
Yahoo's stock took off on the news of her hiring, as investors hoped that she was the company's long-sought savior.	O	O
Mayer transformed the company's culture, raising pay, perks and benefits to attract top-tier talent.	O	O
She streamlined Yahoo's focus, pivoting to mobile, video, native advertising and search in an attempt to unlock growth.	O	O
She bought dozens of tech companies, including her signature $1 billion purchase of social blogging platform Tumblr.	O	O
But Mayer failed at virtually every turn.	O	O
Her tenure was plagued by high-profile executive departures.	O	O
Most notably, she oversaw the disastrous hire of former Googler Henrique De Castro, who was paid $108 million for just 15 months of widely derided work.	O	O
Few of Mayer's purchases made any tangible difference at Yahoo.	O	O
Tumblr never panned out as a viable social media competitor.	O	O
Yahoo has written down half of Tumblr's value this year.	O	O
Even Mayer's focus on mobile, video, native ads and search was a bust.	O	O
That, more than any other factor, precipitated investors' eagerness for Yahoo to sell.	O	O
If Yahoo was incapable of a turnaround on its own right, shareholders believed the only viable path forward was a sale.	B	Yahoo
Mayer's epitaph was effectively chiseled in March, when hedge fund Starboard Value said it had lost faith in Yahoo's management.	O	O
Yahoo has been doing battle with Starboard for a year and a half, and it eventually lost the battle in April when the hedge fund's manager Jeff Smith was appointed to Yahoo's board.	O	O
With a sale certain and Mayer's ouster likely, Yahoo's board adjusted its bylaws three months ago to make it much easier for Mayer and other executives to get a huge payday.	O	O
The new bylaws make clear that selling Yahoo's internet business would represent a control change, letting Mayer take home three times as much as she would have otherwise earned.	O	O

Verizon Plans To Acquire Yahoo In $4.83 Billion Deal
Verizon Communications Inc. said Monday it would buy Yahoo Inc’s core internet properties for $4.83 billion in cash to expand its digital advertising and media business, in a deal that ends a lengthy sale process for the fading Web pioneer.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
The purchase of Yahoo’s operations will boost Verizon’s AOL internet business (AOL is the Huffington Post’s parent company), which it bought last year for $4.4 billion, and give it access to Yahoo’s ad technology tools, BrightRoll and Flurry, and assets such as search, mail and messenger.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion

“The sale of our operating business, which effectively separates our Asian asset equity stakes, is an important step in our plan to unlock shareholder value for Yahoo,” Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said in a statement on Monday.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion

Also included in the deal: the Yahoo brand and real estate attached to the core business including Yahoo’s headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif.	O	O
By pairing Yahoo with AOL — which Verizon bought in May 2015 for $4.4 billion — Verizon’s resulting digital media unit could represent another competitive option for advertisers currently flocking to Google and Facebook.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
In addition to its valuable ad tech, Yahoo also has digital content such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance and Tumblr, the blogging service it acquired in 2013 for $1.1 billion.	O	O
Across its various properties, Yahoo draws 1 billion monthly users.	O	O

The telecommunications company and its AOL unit were attracted by those 1 billion monthly users, said AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who will oversee the integration under the purview of Marni Walden, Verizon’s executive VP and president of the product innovation and new businesses.	O	O
“The scale game has really changed, and my guess is in the next five years it’s going to even more dramatically change,” Armstrong told USA TODAY on Monday.	O	O
“So putting these companies together gives us a very significant leg up in terms of competing for the future.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion

When the transaction closes — which is expected in the first quarter of 2017 — Yahoo will change its name and become a publicly traded investment company, the company said.	O	O
CEO Marissa Mayer will help with the transition and could stay on long term, Armstrong said.	O	O
Verizon will lean on Yahoo's user base to grow the audience for its mobile and online video properties including its ad-supported go90 network, launched in October 2015, which streams millennial-focused TV, sports and other content to smartphones and mobile devices.	O	O
Shares of Verizon (VZ) were down Monday 0.4% to $55.87.	O	O

A former Google exec, Mayer four years ago came to Yahoo — one of the original Web portals and Internet search destinations — to captain a turnaround.	O	O

Reports that Verizon Communications (VZ) is closing in on a deal to buy Yahoo (YHOO) for about $5 billion raises the question of why the wireless giant wants a company that, while undoubtedly an online pioneer, is today a fading force in the Internet world.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
In fact, there's good reason why Verizon, which plunged into the digital content business last year through its $4.4 billion acquisition of AOL, would want Yahoo.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
First, the U.S. wireless market is stagnant, forcing carriers to spend big money on advertising in hopes of luring customers away from their rivals.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
Smartphone sales, which fueled the industry's growth earlier in the decade, have cooled to the point where consumers who want the device probably already have them, said independent telecommunications analyst Jeff Kagan.	O	O
According to the trade publication Fierce Wireless, in the first half of 2015 smartphone sales fell for the first time on a year-over-year basis.	O	O
Moreover, fewer customers are buying new smartphones or upgrading their existing devices as they await the launch of the iPhone 7, expected sometime this year.	O	O
Play Video Marissa Mayer on Yahoo's struggles, future strategy Of course, wireless customers are using data and apps more than ever, which is supporting the industry's profit margins.	O	O
Verizon and other wireless companies are betting that providing original content will solve their growth problems.	O	O
Some experts are skeptical.	O	O
"These are not big, growing companies," said Kagan, referring to Yahoo and AOL, adding that they won't "transform" Verizon.	B	Yahoo
"I am not convinced that this is going to work.	I	Yahoo

Yahoo was once valued at $125 billion, making this deal of $4.8 billion look pitiful	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
US telecoms giant Verizon has just announced that it has bought Yahoo for $4.8 billion (£3.8 billion).	O	O
The internet search firm has sold off all of its core assets including its email service, news, finance and sports websites, as well as its advertising tools.	O	O
For the past eight years, Yahoo has been struggling to reach its financial targets, losing out to the likes of Google and Facebook.	O	O
Last year the announcement of a £3.4 billion loss seemed to the be final nail in the coffin for the search engine.	O	O
Yahoo peaked in the early 2000s, but has been in dire straits for the least few yearsWhat does this mean for you if you use Yahoo's services.	O	O
Well, potentially, Verizon may integrate Yahoo email with AOL mail.	B	Verizon
When Verizon bought AOL back in June 2015, it merged all its Verizon email customer accounts into AOL Mail accounts.	O	O
That meant Verizon email account holders had to re-register to AOL Mail and set a new password.	O	O
However their actual email addresses stayed exactly the same - the only thing that changed was their login page.	O	O
The same may potentially happen to Yahoo email accounts.	O	O
This could mean you will have to re-register with AOL mail, but you will probably still be able to keep your @yahoo.com email address.	O	O
There may even be some upgrades to your account.	O	O
Verizon spruced up AOL's email service, giving customers unlimited storage and email attachments up to 25 MB.	O	O
It also created advanced spam filters and virus protection.	O	O
While this migration over to AOL mail has not been confirmed, a Bloomberg report said that acquiring Yahoo will give Verizon "a complimentary set of businesses that could find a home alongside its AOL properties".	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
The report also outlined that AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong may be a "key asset to make the integration (of Yahoo and AOL) a success".	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
If AOL Mail and Yahoo do merge, your new login page may offer you a broader range of digital services.	O	O
Verizon will hope to optimise Yahoo's established assets, including its websites focused on news, sport, and the social media platform Tumblr.	B	Yahoo
For now though, if you are a Yahoo email account holder, sit tight.	O	O
You'll be notified if you are required to do anything and will be given simple instructions on how to re-register.	O	O
Verizon no doubt will also provide free technical support if any issues do arise.	O	O
Will this be enough to turn Yahoo's fortune around.	O	O
At the peak of its dot-com bubble success, Yahoo was valued at $125 billion.	O	O
Things started to take a nose dive when Google came onto the scene, which had innovative email features and an improved, more intuitive search engine.	O	O
To add insult to injury, Yahoo passed up an opportunity to buy Facebook for $1 billion in 2006, and Google for $1 million in 1997, and again in 2002.	O	O
Then in 2005 the company rejected Microsoft’s offer to buy it for $44 billion.	O	O
Making this final deal of $4.8 billion seem pitiful.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
The CEO, Marissa Mayer, is expected to resign, but she will take with her a hefty $57 million payoff.	O	O
For the rest of Yahoo's 8,800 employees, their fate remains uncertain.	O	O
No doubt Verizon will streamline Yahoo's workforce as they integrate the two company's together.	O	O

Yahoo's market value remains far from its 1999 high.
USA TODAY's Matt Krantz explains why Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer was awarded so much money as the company's fortunes waned.	O	O
It's the end of Yahoo (YHOO) as we know it with Verizon (VZ) buying the Internet company for a fraction of what it once was worth.	O	O
Yet, CEO Marissa Mayer did very well for herself during her run.	O	O
The chief of the fallen Internet giant was paid $139.6 million over her four years of service at the Internet company.	O	O
That doesn't even include the estimated golden parachute payment of $54.9 million she would get if she steps down, something she says she doesn't plan to do.	O	O
Mayer's total haul at the company was even higher - $162 million - when factoring in how much the stock options she was given are worth now, according to compensation firm Equilar.	O	O
Equilar says her total windfall, including a current value of her severance if she leaves, is $218.9 million.	O	O
Seeing the size of Mayer's payout could be painful for investors who saw the company's revenue stagnate during her tenure.	O	O
Yahoo went from making a profit of nearly $4 billion a year to losing $4.5 billion and paying billions for small companies that haven't paid off or were largely written off.	O	O
Shares of Yahoo increased 145% under Mayer, but that was mainly due to factors she had little to do with, such as the rising value of the company's stakes in Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba (BABA) and Yahoo Japan that were acquired before Mayer arrived.	O	O
Yahoo's stock price rose "because of the strategy they introduced to unlock the value of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan," says Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi.	B	Yahoo
"That's pretty much it.	O	O
"Mayer, in her statement about the Verizon deal, said, "The sale of our operating business, which effectively separates our Asian asset equity stakes, is an important step in our plan to unlock shareholder value for Yahoo.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
"While there had been speculation among Wall Street observers that Mayer would exit with a Yahoo sale, she said that she plans to stay.	O	O
“I love Yahoo and am excited to see it into its next chapter," she said during a conference call on Monday.	B	Yahoo
Although Yahoo has a market value of $37.4 billion, the core business was sold to Verizon for a fraction of that -- to the tune of $4.8 billion.	O	O
Investors know the bulk of Yahoo's value isn't about the core business.	B	Yahoo
Yahoo's stake in Alibaba is worth roughly $32 billion and its stake in Yahoo Japan was valued at $8.7 billion.	O	O
That implies the market sees Yahoo's core business as worthless.	B	Yahoo
However, it also masks the full value of Yahoo’s core business, since it was being discounted due to the risk of triggering a tax bill, Mogharabi says.	B	Yahoo
Mayer's efforts couldn't get the company back to its former glory.	O	O
At its peak in 1999, Yahoo was valued at more than $109 billion, or nearly triple its current value.	O	O
During her time as CEO, Mayer has pushed to boost mobile, video and social efforts.	O	O
The company spent more than $3 billion buying or investing in more than 51 companies ranging from Flurry, an advertising platform for mobile applications to Tomfoolery, a smartphone applications developer, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.	O	O
One deal that highlights the issues with that strategy was Yahoo's $1.1 billion buy of micro-blogging site Tumblr in May 2013.	O	O
That was it's biggest purchase under Mayer.	O	O
Yahoo has since written off 70% of the price it paid, says Mogharabi.	O	O
"That tells you this didn't work out that well," he says.	O	O
Yahoo's market value remains far from its 1999 high.	O	O
Investors hope the Yahoo core assets will be more valuable inside Verizon, if the telecom company can be a strong competitor to Facebook and Alphabet.	B	Yahoo
Verizon has "ample data about consumers, and it intends to marry this data with the data already residing at YHOO (as well as AOL and other Internet assets) to also effect better targeting," Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities wrote in a note to clients.	B	Verizon

Yahoo Inc YHOO.O is focusing on U.S. telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) as the buyer of its core business after reviewing final bids that it received this week, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.	O	O
A deal would boost Verizon’s AOL internet business, which the company acquired last year for $4.4 billion, by giving it access to Yahoo’s advertising technology tools, as well other assets such as search, mail, messenger and real estate.	O	O
These synergies have made Verizon the favorite among industry analysts to prevail in the auction.	B	Verizon
The sale would also mark the end of Yahoo as an operating company, leaving it only as the owner of a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, as well as its 15 percent interest in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).	O	O
Those two stakes account for most of Yahoo’s $37 billion market capitalization.	O	O
Yahoo views Verizon as the buyer that can deliver the most value, but negotiations between the two companies are continuing, and no agreement has yet been reached, the sources said.	B	Verizon
Yahoo would like to have a deal for the core assets by the end of July, one of the sources added.	O	O
Bloomberg News, which reported earlier that Verizon was nearing an agreement to buy the Yahoo assets, cited an anonymous source as saying the companies were discussing a price close to $5 billion.	O	O
Yahoo shares were up 0.6 percent at $39.09 in morning trading, while Verizon rose 1.3 percent to $56.09.	O	O
The sources requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential.	O	O
Verizon and Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment.	O	O
“Verizon has always been the favorite because it has the largest potential synergies and therefore can pay the most,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.	B	Verizon
“The price negotiations still can be tough because it also doesn’t need Yahoo.	I	Verizon
It can put its money into its AOL franchise.	I	Verizon
”Verizon is already working on increasing revenue through its go90 ad-supported mobile video service targeted at millennials.	O	O
The app, which was introduced in October, offers videos from Comedy Central, Vice and other programmers, as well as basketball and football games.	O	O
Other bidders for the Yahoo assets include Verizon rival AT&T (T.N); a consortium led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett; private equity firm TPG Capital LP; and a consortium of buyout firms Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners, sources have said previously.	O	O
Slideshow (2 Images)AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong, who made his name leading sales at Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, is highly regarded in the advertising community.	O	O
Analysts say it is unlikely that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, another former Google high-flyer who has struggled to turn her internet company around, would join him at AOL.	O	O
LOSING GROUND TO COMPETITORS In December, Yahoo scrapped plans to spin off its Alibaba stake after investors fretted over whether that transaction could have been carried out on a tax-free basis.	O	O
It instead decided to explore a sale of its core assets, spurred on by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP.	O	O
Yahoo said in April that Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith and three independent directors associated with him would join its board immediately.	O	O
All four were on a slate that Starboard had proposed to oust Yahoo’s entire board.	O	O
Started in 1994 by Stanford graduate students Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo in its early years was the destination of choice for many making their first forays into the World Wide Web.	O	O
The company soared and then crashed in the first dot-com bubble before emerging as one of the few internet companies with substantial revenues and profits.	O	O
By 2008, Yahoo was fending off a contentious takeover bid from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and struggling to define its mission.	O	O
That question was never really answered, leading to years of management instability and shifting priorities.	O	O
Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O. and a host of new companies, meanwhile, claimed much of the territory that might have been Yahoo’s.	O	O

Yahoo\u2019s remaining assets to rebrand after sale to Verizon in 2017
One asset that Verizon  will be getting as part of its $4.83 billion acquisition of Yahoo’s  core assets, which it did not specifically mention in its big announcement today, is Yahoo’s (in)famous brand — main name, purple color and exclamation mark all included.	O	O
This, in turn, means that when the deal is completed (expected Q1 2017) the remaining Yahoo will rename itself and will become a separate, registered publicly traded investment business, the company said today.	O	O
It’s not clear if Verizon and AOL (which owns us, TechCrunch) intend to keep the Yahoo branding that they are acquiring.	O	O
Generally, they’ve held on to brands when ingesting them, and like it or hate it, Yahoo’s brand is huge.	O	O
Indeed, later today, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong noted, “Don’t touch the brands.	O	O
”As of today, the business that will stay behind post-acquisition by Verizon includes Yahoo’s cash, its shares in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, Yahoo’s convertible notes, certain minority investments, and Yahoo’s non-core patents (called the Excalibur portfolio).	O	O
IP that is connected specifically to Yahoo’s core assets will be part of the Verizon acquisition, and Yahoo is still looking for a separate deal for the patents that are in the Excalibur portfolio.	O	O
That portfolio is estimated at upwards of $1 billion by Yahoo.	O	O
There are around 4,000 patents, both issued and applications for pending patents, as part of Excalibur, Yahoo said today, but the implication was that they were not getting the kinds of offers that it had hoped to get.	O	O
“We didn’t want this to be an afterthought to the rest of the assets,” chair of the strategic review committee, Tom McInerney, said in a conference call today.	O	O
It also sounds like there is an option either to continue trying to sell them, or perhaps license them directly, which is already the case with some of these patents, McInerney said today.	O	O
The shares in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, meanwhile, respectively are valued at $31.2 billion and $8.3 billion.	O	O
The company today reiterated that it cancelled its decision to sell off those stakes as originally planned because of the tax burden for doing so.	O	O
Today, during Yahoo’s investor call, it also raised the possibility that someone else could buy those stakes after the sale to Verizon, although for now it seems the strategy is more just to get the assets separated without any hitches.	O	O
As for cash, Yahoo says it “intends to return substantially all of its net cash to shareholders and will determine and communicate a specific capital return strategy at an appropriate time.	O	O
”Marissa Mayer — the much-watched CEO who was hired to turn around Yahoo but ultimately did not succeed despite years of acquisitions and many big plans — also confirmed directly that she will stay on for the next stage, whatever that may be.	O	O
But no info on what comes after that is completed.	O	O
“For me personally, I’m planning to stay. I love Yahoo, and I believe in all of you.	B	Yahoo
It’s important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter,” she notes in her memo to Yahoos.	I	Yahoo
And in the conference call today, in response to an investor question about the topic, she again did not reveal any long term plan for her own role, as she noted that she will both help with the transition, as well as staying on to help settle the remaining assets of the company.	O	O
It’s notable that in Verizon’s news release it does not indicate any specific title or role for her as part of the sale, although AOL CEO Tim Armstrong mentions her helping with the transition to Verizon in his own memo.	O	O

Why Verizon wants to buy Yahoo
it also wants to become a formidable media company.	B	Verizon
Verizon took one step closer to that goal when it announced Monday that it would buy Yahoo for $4.8 billion.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
"By acquiring Yahoo, we are scaling up to be a major competitor in mobile media," Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said in a statement Tuesday, when the company reported second quarter earnings.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
And like many media companies, Verizon (VZ) believes that focusing on mobile content will help it attract millennials -- young, mobile-addicted consumers who could turn into long-term customers.	O	O
On a call with investors, McAdam specifically pointed to the popularity of Yahoo's mobile services, including sports, finance and email.	O	O
"We just made an exponential leap in capabilities here," said McAdam.	O	O
He noted that people are using their phones more than ever before (Verizon sees the same amount of traffic on its networks in an hour now as it did in a week a decade ago) and that the company has an opportunity to monetize that volume as much as possible.	O	O
Verizon's transformation has been in the works for years, but its investments have ramped up heavily in the past two years.	O	O
Verizon bought AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015, the same year it launched its own mobile video service Go90.	O	O
And earlier this year, Verizon partnered with Hearst to invest in video-driven and millennial-focused media companies, Complex Media and AwesomenessTV.	O	O
Although Verizon sees Yahoo (YHOO) as a complement to these investments, this most recent acquisition may not deliver as much as Verizon hopes.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
"Verizon believes that millennials don't watch linear TV anymore," said Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack.	B	Verizon
But according to Jefferies' case studies, that's not entirely the case.	O	O
Younger viewers still seem to want a lot of traditional content that isn't short-form video, according to McCormack, which could be a disadvantage for Verizon.	O	O
And McCormack said that, anecdotally, Yahoo users tend to be older than millennials.	O	O
"I wonder if they're going to attract the right demographic with this acquisition.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
"Outside of its content acquisition strategy, Verizon's core business saw some stumbling blocks during the most recent quarter.	O	O
Verizon added fewer new wireless customers than it did a year before, and sales fell about 5% as a result of its workers strike in the spring.	O	O

Verizon to buy vehicle management company Fleetmatics for $2.4 billion
Verizon Communications Inc said on Monday it would buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc for about $2.4 billion in cash to bolster its expansion into the connected vehicle and fleet management market.	O	O
The logo of Verizon is seen at a retail store in San Diego, California April 21, 2016.	O	O
RTSJQRXVerizon, the No. 1 U.S wireless company, will pay $60 per share, a premium of about 40 percent to Fleetmatics’ closing price on Friday.	O	O
The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.	O	O
Shares in Fleetmatics soared 39 percent to $59.60 while Verizon dipped 0.7 percent to $55.01.	O	O
Fleetmatics, with North American headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts, develops software that shows fleet operators vehicle location, fuel usage, speed, mileage and other information on their mobile workforce, including a driver’s behavioral data.	O	O
As the market for smartphones and mobile devices gets saturated, Verizon and its biggest rival, AT&T Inc, are hoping that connecting more objects to their networks will provide new revenue.	O	O
The acquisition helps Verizon capture market share in the “highly fragmented and pretty under-penetrated” fleet and mobile workforce management business, Andrés Irlando, chief executive officer of Verizon Telematics, said in an interview.	O	O
The unit connects vehicles to its wireless network and offers applications to track and manage them.	O	O
On Friday, Verizon Telematics closed another deal, to buy California-based Telogis, which builds software to track commercial vehicles and navigation software used by automakers such as Ford Motor Co.	O	O
Terms were not disclosed.	O	O
Verizon Telematics also offers its own fleet management service, called “Networkfleet.	O	O
”“Both Telogis in the enterprise space and Fleetmatics in the (small- and medium-sized businesses) space have what’s widely considered best-in-class technology software platforms, as well as products and services,” Irlando said.	O	O
Fleetmatics’ international presence in regions such as Western Europe and Australia helps Verizon expand the global reach of its telematics business, Irlando added.	O	O
In May, Fleetmatics posted revenue of $78.9 million for the first quarter, up 21 percent from a year earlier.	O	O
Verizon does not break out its telematics unit revenues - it is reported under sales from its larger “Internet of Things” business.	O	O
Aimed at connecting to the internet everything from household devices to industrial machines, the business posted revenue of $205 million in the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, up 25 percent from a year ago, Verizon said last week.	O	O
Verizon, which has been seeking to add new revenue streams, said last week it would buy Yahoo Inc’s core internet assets for $4.8 billion to make a push into the digital media and ad business.	O	O

The Problem With Verizon-Yahoo
Seventeen years ago, it was hard for anyone working in the burgeoning digital media industry to imagine a world where Yahoo (YHOO) and AOL didn’t rule the Web.	B	Yahoo
Yahoo was worth $128 billion.	O	O
AOL merged with Time Warner for $165 billion.	O	O
Surely these were lasting empires.	O	O
Nope	O	O
Today Facebook (fb, -1.07%) and Google (goog, +0.64%) dominate the digital media business.	O	O
Pick your favorite data point to illustrate the point.	O	O
Here’s mine: Together, the two Silicon Valley giants control more than half of the mobile advertising market.	O	O
Over in Basking Ridge, N.J., executives at Verizon Wireless (vzn, +0.00%) have taken notice.	O	O
They have decided that the business they’re in—providing telecommunications services for millions of customers—is slowing, if not boring.	O	O
But digital advertising is interesting.	O	O
Verizon wants in..	O	O
To do that, the company acquired AOL for $4.4 billion last year.	O	O
Today it expanded that strategy, buying Yahoo for $4.8 billion.	O	O
Verizon buying Yahoo and AOL to compete with Facebook and Google is like the New York Knicks signing Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah to compete with the Golden State Warriors.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
It’s like showing up to a war zone armed with dozens of 18th century muskets—hopeful, but unrealistic.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
Here is the problem: Facebook and Google built successful, wildly profitable businesses because they have figured out a way to make money on digital content without actually getting into the messy, expensive business of producing it.	O	O
Verizon, on the other hand, is buying up assets that require huge investments in exactly that.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
AOL owns The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, and a wide variety of digital video assets.	O	O
Under Mayer, Yahoo poured millions into original content, hiring Katie Couric and producing television shows like Community.	O	O
This stuff does not come cheap, and once you make it, there’s no guarantee that people will watch it or advertisers will want to be associated with it.	O	O
On a call with investors today, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer made the case for why advertisers would spend their budgets on a Yahoo-AOL media property over Facebook or Google.	O	O
Both Yahoo and AOL have all the trendy ad formats and buzzwords that brands are clamoring for: programmatic, data, targeting, native advertising, video.	O	O
“What we see here, at first blush, is a lot of scale, a lot of reach, a great alternative for advertisers from the other leading platforms,” Mayer said.	O	O
Verizon can help Yahoo distribute apps, like Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Finance, and Yahoo Weather, to its wireless subscribers.	O	O
Ad dollars, the thinking goes, will naturally follow.	O	O
But that’s not quite how the advertising world works.	O	O
Like fickle users who adopt an app or a product only to abandon it when it becomes uncool, advertisers expect more than the latest banner ad format.	O	O
They want a halo of cool; they want “millennials;” they want to spend their ad dollars on platforms that their boss won’t question.	O	O
Today, that means Facebook and Google.	O	O
It’s hard to see how combining two declining assets and attaching them to a wireless provider will change that.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion

T-Mobile's John Legere says Verizon-Yahoo is 'slippery slope'
John Legere wishes Verizon luck with its pending acquisition of Yahoo’s core assets.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
Mobile’s CEO, never shy about bashing rivals, kept up the refrain when asked about Verizon's $4.8 billion Yahoo deal, which Verizon execs hope will make it a major competitor in mobile media.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
“It becomes clear that they see customers as units of advertising revenue,” Legere told USA TODAY in an interview, noting Verizon has spent over $10 billion, including on AOL, to make this transformation into a media platform.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
“They’re going into that game against the most powerful companies, Facebook and Google. I think it’s going to be a slippery slope for them.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
”Legere added that, “I don’t think it impacts us.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
”Legere’s remarks came after T-Mobile said earnings fell to $225 million, or 25 cents a share, 4 cents better than forecasts compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.	O	O
Sales rose 13% to $9.2 billion.	O	O
The company said it has added 1.9 million net new customers, the 13th quarter in a row in which it has added at least one million new customers, also topping forecasts.	O	O
Most came at the expense of AT&T and Verizon, executives said.	O	O
The nation’s third largest wireless carrier also said its “churn rate” or the customers who bail on the service, is at 1.27%, a record low.	O	O
It raised its full-year forecast for net, postpaid subscriber additions.	O	O
T-Mobile’s chief operating officer Mike Sievert also weighed in on the Verizon-Yahoo deal, along with AT&T’s acquisition of DirecTV.	O	O
“Surely it will distract them from their core business.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
”T-Mobile’s stock rose 2% to $45.86.	O	O

This is what's left of Yahoo after Verizon deal
Verizon already owns AOL, now the telecom company expands its media empire by adding Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance and Tumblr.	O	O
Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAYIn the case of Yahoo, what's left of the former Silicon Valley giant is likely worth more than what's been sold.	O	O
On Monday, Verizon said it will pay $4.8 billion in cash for acquire Yahoo's core business, which includes its email service, web assets, ad-tech operations and the Yahoo brand.	O	O
The deal will close by the first quarter of 2017.	O	O
CEO Marissa Mayer will also move on to Verizon.	O	O
The rest of Yahoo will morph into a yet-to-be-named publicly traded investment company, with a 15% stake in Alibaba worth $32 billion and a 35.5% stake in Yahoo Japan worth about $8 billion.	O	O
The new company, referred to as RemainCo in a conference call to investors Monday, also owns convertible notes, Yahoo cash, minority investments and non-core patents, said a joint statement from Verizon and Yahoo.	O	O
Those valuable stakes stem from prescient investments made over a decade ago.	O	O
In 2005, Yahoo announced a partnership with Alibaba that included investing $1 billion in the Chinese retailer for a 40% economic interest.	O	O
Alibaba has since become a retailing giant in China, spawning the biggest initial public offering in the U.S. when it started trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014.	O	O
Alibaba (BABA) boasts a market cap topping $200 billion.	O	O
"That should go down as one of the greatest investments of publicly traded companies," says Scott Kessler of S&P Global Market Intelligence of Yahoo's Alibaba stake.	O	O
In 2012, Yahoo sold half its Alibaba stake for $7.1 billion.	O	O
In recent quarters, Yahoo's stock market success was tied closely to Alibaba.	O	O
Yahoo had originally planned to spin off its Alibaba stake as part of a plan to reinvigorate its business, but backed off that plan over concerns it wouldn't be tax free.	O	O
Activist investors then pressured it to sell its core assets.	O	O
Yahoo Japan is the other big part of the remaining company.	O	O
It launched as a web portal in 1996, in a joint venture between Yahoo and Japanese company Softbank, which owns approximately a 43% stake in the company, according to SunTrust analyst Robert Peck.	O	O
Yahoo Japan is among the most popular websites in the country, closely trailing behind Google, according to rankings released in March by research firm comScore.	O	O
Softbank is viewed as a "natural buyer" for the stake in Yahoo Japan, if it shows interest, says Peck.	O	O
"If SoftBank isn’t interested, we think Yahoo could possibly sell the shares to Japanese investors or distribute to current shareholders.	B	Yahoo
"A representative for Softbank couldn't be reached for comment.	O	O
S&P Global Market Intelligence's Kessler says there are still several issues to untangle, such as who will lead the new company as well as assessing the value of both stakes.	O	O
"How do you value those assets especially given that we don’t really know what the tax implications of those will be.	O	O
" he asked.	O	O

Verizon is diversifying away from being a telephone and internet provider. The Fleetmatics deal follows Verizon\u2019s pact to buy Yahoo last week.
Verizon Communications  Inc.	O	O
VZ 3.01%  said Monday that it agreed to acquire mobile workforce-solutions company Fleetmatics Group PLC for $2.4 billion, widening Verizon’s fleet operations as it looks to diversify.	O	O
The deal, at $60 a share in cash, represents a nearly 40% premium to Fleetmatics closing price Friday of $42.96.	O	O
Shares of Fleetmatics rose 39% to $59.66 in morning trading in New York and are up 65% in the past three months.	O	O
Verizon stock, up 20% this year, edged down 0.1% to $55.35.	O	O
Fleetmatics’ web-based GPS tracking systems allow fleet operators to monitor vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage, and other insights into their mobile workforce.	O	O
Fleetmatics opened on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012 at $22.95, up from its $17 offer price.	O	O
Investors were attracted to the company because its cloud-computing model made adoption easy for small-to midsize business without other infrastructure or sophisticated users.	O	O
The Dublin-based company has roughly 737,000 subscribers and 1,200 employees.	O	O
Its North American headquarters are in Waltham, Mass.	O	O
RelatedLast week, Verizon closed its acquisition of mobile enterprise management software company Telogis Inc.	O	O
That transaction, as well as the Fleetmatics deal, came amid Verizon’s bidding for Yahoo Inc., which it last week agreed to buy for $4.8 billion.	O	O
For New York-based Verizon, the Yahoo deal represents a bet that the troubled web company will give it a leg up as it tries to build a digital media and advertising empire.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
Meanwhile, the Fleetmatics deal reflects its strategy of connecting objects to the internet wirelessly.	O	O
Both come as Verizon, the nation’s largest U.S. wireless carrier, is diversifying away from being a telephone and internet provider.	O	O
The Fleetmatics transaction, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions such as the approval of Fleetmatics shareholders, is expected to close in the fourth quarter.	O	O

(Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press)Verizon is reportedly nearing a deal to purchase Yahoo for close to $5 billion, bringing to an end a months-long bidding process for a now-ailing company that was once an Internet trailblazer.	O	O
Verizon, the nation's largest wireless carrier, has been building itself into an online content business.	O	O
Last year, it acquired AOL — one of Yahoo's longstanding rivals — for $4.4 billion (Mayer rejected a deal to merge with AOL in 2015).	O	O
A purchase could open the doors for Verizon to generate additional revenue through Yahoo's editorial properties, video services and advertising technology.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
Verizon is perceived as a favorite because it sees the most value in Yahoo, said Rob Enderle, principal analyst with the Enderle Group.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
Although Yahoo brings in revenue, its costs are too high.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
By joining forces with AOL, Yahoo's costs would come down, he said.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
Thanks to its AOL purchase, Verizon is now the owner of sites including the Huffington Post, Engadget and TechCrunch.	O	O
With Yahoo, it would gain highly visited properties such as Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports, among others.	O	O
"Verizon clearly wants to build a media center to rival Comcast's positioning as being both a telco and a media company," said Andrew Frank, an analyst with research firm Gartner, who isn't surprised Verizon is emerging as the leading bidder.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion

By buying Yahoo, Verizon scoops up a rare prize: Silicon Valley real estate
But it has also secured something equally coveted in Silicon Valley: real estate.	O	O
When the deal closes, the New York telecom giant will become one of the largest office landlords in the nation's technology hub thanks to the roughly 1 million-square-foot campus Yahoo owns in Sunnyvale, Calif. — a desirable position amid the current tech boom.	O	O
Indeed, the office market has been on a multiyear upswing as tech giants and start-ups have expanded.	O	O
Mark Ritchie, president of Ritchie Commercial, valued Yahoo's Sunnyvale property at roughly $500 million.	O	O
That's one-tenth of what Verizon has agreed to shell out for the entire company — a percentage that reflects both Yahoo's fall from grace as well as the demand for Silicon Valley land.	B	Yahoo
Average office rents in the second quarter were $4.17 a square foot, nearly 70 cents higher than a year earlier, according to commercial real estate brokerage JLL.	O	O
Vacancy, meanwhile, ticked down 1.5 percentage points to 12.1%.	O	O
"Silicon Valley is really difficult real estate-wise," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at real estate firm Trulia.	O	O
And developers are still building.	O	O
In total, they broke ground on 2.5 million square feet of office space in the second quarter, according to commercial real estate brokerage JLL.	O	O
Still — like the tech boom itself — there are questions how long the good times can last, especially as venture capital funding declines.	O	O
JLL said that leasing activity has slowed and new buildings are increasingly opening vacant.	O	O
What Verizon ultimately plans to do with its new real estate hinges on answers to such larger economic questions, as well as some issues particular to the telecom.	B	Verizon
Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to comment, other than to say it intends to acquire "any real estate associated with Yahoo's core business operations, including the Sunnyvale property.	O	O
"There are several options once the deal is finalized, which is expected to happen early next year.	O	O
Verizon could sell the real estate and lease it back, hold onto it and bet values will rise or sell it to another user.	O	O
Such decisions, of course, are usually based on staffing.	O	O
The Yahoo deal comes a year after Verizon snatched up Yahoo's longtime New York rival AOL, which it said it plans to integrate with the Sunnyvale firm.	O	O
"A lot of this is still up in the air," said Mark Rogers, a corporate governance expert who has been following Yahoo's travails.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
"This is going to take some time to shake out.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
"If Verizon sells the property, Ritchie said it would find plenty of willing buyers.	O	O
Most of the slowdown, he said, has been in the smaller office spaces sought by start-ups, which are struggling to secure financing after years of easy money.	O	O
Venture funding in the U.S. was down nearly 18% in the first half the year compared with last year, according to KPMG.	O	O
Verizon must also decide what to do with the property Yahoo leases, which according to CoStar Group includes about 131,000 square feet in Playa Vista.	O	O
In recent years, Playa Vista, along with nearby Venice and Santa Monica, have become somewhat of a Silicon Valley south.	O	O
Google and Facebook have set up shop there alongside homegrown L.A. tech companies such as Snapchat, the fast-growing messaging platform.	O	O

Verizon for Yahoo!: A \u2018Clueless\u2019 Repeat of Terremark \u2018Disaster,\u2019 Says Global Equities
While there was a mixture of positive and skeptical reactions to Verizon Communications’s (VZ) announcement this morning it would buy Yahoo’s (YHOO) “core” advertising business for $4.83 billion, the sharpest words of criticism as far as Verizon came from Global Equities’s Trip Chowdhry, who believes that “Verizon shareholders are setting themselves up for a huge disappointment.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
"Chowdhry thinks the deal will be a repeat of Verizon’s 2011 purchase of data center hosting outfit Terremark Worldwide, which cost $1.4 billion, which he labels a “total disaster.	I	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
It is a total disaster, and today VZ is trying to sell off this P.O.Sand sadly the same is going to happen with YHOO acquisition.	B	Verizon buys Yahoo for $4.8 billion
Among the negatives of Yahoo, in Chowdhry’s view:YHOO is a declining asset business - recovery, or sustainability is impossible: YHOO is a non-event in each and every Internet Trend: Internet is going Visual - YHOO is a non-event Internet is going real-time-messaging - YHOO is a non-event Internet is going "Live-streaming" - YHOO is a non-event Internet is going mobile - YHOO is a non-event Internet is going social - YHOO is a non-event Internet is going social-payments - YHOO is a non-event Machine Learning is driving - Preference Vector, Interest Vector, Knowledge Vector, Association Vector, etc.	B	Yahoo
YHOO has nothing to offer, fundamentally it is an obsolete offering. He concludes "Basically, we are seeing a replay of the previous movie, VZ buys Terremark, but with a different actor, YHOO replacing Terremark.	I	Yahoo
"Verizon executives are "as clueless as they have been with Terremark,” claims Chowdhry, while "Nitwit analysts and industry visionaries are playing the same song with VZ + YHOO, that they had played when VZ + Terremark Fundamental problem with VZ has not changed - VZ has zero insights and zero innovation.

Apple faces a record-setting tax bill of up to $14.5 billion after the European Union ruled Ireland had given it illegal tax benefits.	O	O
A three-year investigation by the E.U.'s executive branch ruled that Ireland's tax dealings with the California tech giant breached rules on state aid and that Dublin must recover the unpaid taxes, plus interest.	O	O
However, the exact amount could be reduced by agreement or if Apple agreed to pay more tax to other countries.	O	O
Apple and the Irish government both said they would appeal the decision.	O	O

PAUL FAITH / AFP - Getty ImagesThe case centers on deals that encouraged the U.S. tech giant to route vast profits through Ireland, even though EU state aid laws bar governments giving some firms unfair advantages.	O	O
The European Commission — the E.U.'s executive arm — first accused Ireland in 2014 of dodging international tax rules by letting Apple shelter profits worth tens of billions of dollars from tax collectors in return for maintaining jobs.	O	O
It found the multinational's effective corporate tax rate on its European profits dropped from 1 percent in 2003 to a mere 0.0005 percent in 2014.	O	O
For each $1.12 million in profits, Apple paid just $55 in tax.	O	O
“Ireland must now recover the unpaid taxes in Ireland from Apple for the years 2003 to 2014 of up to €13 billion [$14.5 billion] plus interest," the Commission announced Tuesday.	O	O
It said Apple had also avoided tax on its profits across the E.U. by recording all sales in Ireland rather than in the country where the devices were actually sold.	O	O
If Apple agreed to repay tax to the other countries, "this would reduce the amount to be recovered by Ireland,” it said.	O	O
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told a news conference in Brussels Tuesday that there was "no justification" for the tax deal.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
She added: "This is not a penalty, it is unpaid tax.	O	O
"Apple employs 5,500 workers, or about a quarter of its European-based staff in the Irish city of Cork, where it is the largest private-sector employer.	O	O
It has said it paid Ireland's 12.5 percent rate on all the income that it generates in the country.	O	O
Ireland's low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of economic policy for 20 years, drawing investors from major multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 workers in Ireland.	O	O
Ireland's finance minister, Michael Noonan, said: “I disagree profoundly with the Commission’s decision.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal the decision.	O	O
"He said it was "important that we send a strong message that Ireland remains an attractive and stable location of choice for long-term substantive investment.	O	O

Apple tax ruling is unfair, says former European commissioner
The European commission’s decision that Apple owes Ireland €13bn (£11bn) in unpaid taxes has been branded “fundamentally unfair” by its former competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Writing for the Guardian, Kroes attacked Tuesday’s ruling by Margrethe Vestager, her successor as Europe’s top competition watchdog.	I	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
The commission found that Ireland had breached state-aid rules by allowing the California technology group to pay substantially less tax than other businesses since 1991.	O	O
It made a similar ruling against Starbucks and Fiat in the Netherlands last year, and has used state-aid laws to launch ongoing investigations into Amazon and McDonald’s in Luxembourg.	O	O
Why EU state aid is not the right tool to fight tax avoidance	O	O
Kroes said state-aid rules should not apply to tax matters.	O	O
“EU member states have a sovereign right to determine their own tax laws,” she said.	O	O
“State aid cannot be used to rewrite those rules.	O	O
However, the current state-aid investigations into tax rulings appear to do exactly that.	O	O
”Apple routes the majority of its European and other foreign revenues through Ireland.	O	O
The commission found Apple’s effective rate of corporation tax at one subsidiary in Ireland was just 0.005% of its profits in 2014 – equal to a tax bill of just €50 on each €1m of profit.	O	O
Why Apple is facing a €13bn tax bill in Ireland Kroes is also critical of the retrospective nature of the ruling, which determined that Apple had underpaid its Irish taxes from 2003 until 2014, saying a fundamental principle of tax law is that changes do not apply to past years.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
She writes: “You cannot change the rules of the game through ad hoc state-aid enforcement, and then seek retroactive recovery for unpaid taxes.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Doing so would be fundamentally unfair and would harm competition, growth and tax income in Europe.	I	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
And it raises serious questions about legal certainty and the rule of law.	I	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
”The Dutch former politician, who headed the commission’s competition directorate from 2004 to 2010, now sits on the public policy board of the taxi-hailing business Uber, a technology group headquartered in California.	O	O
Uber uses subsidiaries in the Netherlands to shield its overseas income from United States taxes.	O	O
“We all agree on the need to tackle tax avoidance, but such reform should come from a transparent legislative process within the EU and through consensus building in international fora,” says Kroes.	O	O
She argues that the commission’s use of state-aid laws to force companies to pay more tax risks undermining the work of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which has been pushing for more transparency around the tax paid by multinationals and ways to block the use of artificial structures designed to cut tax bills.

Theresa May's spokesman said the UK would "welcome any company" in the wake of the tax row GettyDowning Street has signalled it would “welcome any company” to the UK, just hours after an unprecedented EU tax-decision left a question mark over Apple’s future in Ireland.	O	O
Number 10 and the Treasury said Britain was “open for business” after being asked whether it was comfortable with the tech-giant coming to Britain, following a decision which left it facing an Irish tax bill running into billions of pounds.	O	O
Chancellor Philip Hammond has already raised fears of a European ‘tax war’ and drawn criticism from one EU leader after saying the UK is ready to bolster the British economy with business levy cuts.	O	O
His department’s statement following the EU decision on Apple is likely to heighten tensions, with the Irish government scrambling to say it would launch an appeal to protect the low-rate Apple pays in Ireland.	O	O
It is also likely to anger tax campaigners who applauded the Irish decision and fear Theresa May’s Government may turn post-Brexit Britain into a tax haven for multi-national corporations.	O	O
The European Commission said the 'sweetheart' deal Ireland made with Apple had allowed the company to unlawfully avoid paying some £11bn in tax.	O	O
Its decision was a major blow for Ireland, which has sought to attract inward investment by lowering its corporation tax rate to 12.5 per cent.	O	O
Asked if the UK would like to see Apple locate here, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The narrative of the Government has been well set out.	O	O
Britain is open for business, we welcome any company wishing to invest in Britain and Britain’s workforce.	O	O
”The Treasury later followed suit, releasing a statement saying: “The UK is open for business and we welcome any company wishing to invest in Britain, but we have always been clear that companies that do business here must pay UK taxes.	O	O
“That’s why we led the G20 in creating international rules to make sure taxes are paid where profits are made and why we introduced the diverted profits tax to tackle profits moved overseas when they should rightly be taxed in the UK.	O	O
”Apple’s tax arrangements in Ireland are based on an agreement drawn up in 1991, when Apple was struggling against the PC boom, and another in 2007, which allowed the company to pay a significantly reduced rate of tax on profits over more than 10 years.	O	O
But following a three-year long investigation, EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said member states couldn't give such tax benefits to selected companies.	O	O
She claimed the selective treatment allowed to Apple had left it paying an effective corporate tax rate of just 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014.	O	O
She went on: “This is illegal under EU state aid rules.	O	O
The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years.	O	O
”Apple said it would challenge the ruling, paving the way for an international political and financial dispute over the Commission’s authority.	O	O
In a defiant statement, the tech firm accused the Commission of launching “an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe” and “upend the international tax system”.	B	EU

EU Ax Set To Fall On Apple
The European Commission will rule against Ireland’s tax dealings with Apple on Tuesday, two source familiar with the decision told Reuters, one of whom said Dublin would be told to recoup over 1 billion euros in back taxes.	O	O
The Commission declined to comment on Monday.	O	O
The European Commission accused Ireland in 2014 of dodging international tax rules by letting Apple shelter profits worth tens of billions of dollars from tax collectors in return for maintaining jobs.	O	O
Apple and Ireland rejected the accusation; both have said they will appeal any adverse ruling.	O	O
The source said the Commission will recommend a figure in back taxes that it expects to be collected, but it will be up to Irish authorities to calculate exactly what is owed.	O	O
A bill in excess of 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion) would be far more than the 30 million euros each the European Commission previously ordered Dutch authorities to recover from U.S. coffee chain Starbucks and Luxembourg from Fiat Chrysler for their tax deals.	O	O
Both companies and countries have appealed those decisions.	O	O
When it opened the Apple investigation in 2014, the Commission told the Irish government that tax rulings it agreed in 1991 and 2007 with the iPhone maker amounted to state aid and might have broken EU laws.	O	O
The Commission said the rulings were “reverse engineered” to ensure that Apple had a minimal Irish bill and that minutes of meetings between Apple representatives and Irish tax officials showed the company’s tax treatment had been “motivated by employment considerations.	O	O
”Apple employs 5,500 workers, or about a quarter of its European-based staff in the Irish city of Cork, where it is the largest private sector employer.	O	O
It has said it paid Ireland’s 12.5 percent rate on all the income that it generates in the country.	O	O
Ireland’s low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of economic policy for 20 years, drawing investors from major multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 workers in Ireland.	O	O
Some opposition Irish lawmakers have urged Dublin to collect whatever tax the Commission orders it to.	O	O
But the main opposition party Fianna Fail, whose support the minority administration relies on to pass laws, said it would support an appeal based on the reassurances it had been given by the government to date.	O	O

At 54, and bored with retirement, he decided to apply for a job at an Apple Genius Bar, the in-person customer support locations at Apple’s high street stores, which tend to be staffed by younger people.	O	O
Sure enough, the other applicants at his group interview were all half his age.	O	O
Author Ashton Applewhite wrote about the episode in an article on age discrimination for the New York Times.	O	O

Irish Cabinet Agrees to Fight EU on Apple Tax

REUTERS/Noah BergerREUTERSIreland's coalition government on Friday agreed to appeal against a multi-billion-euro back tax demand that the European Commission has slapped on iPhone maker Apple after independent members of the cabinet gave their backing, a spokesman said.	O	O
"A motion will come before the Dail (parliament) on Wednesday seeking an endorsement of that decision," the government spokesman said.	O	O
REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann The fragile government met on Friday to overcome cabinet divisions on whether to join Apple in appealing against a multi-billion-euro back tax demand that the European Commission has slapped on the iPhone maker.	O	O
Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating the U.S. tech giant's Irish tax affairs in 2014.	O	O
But at an earlier cabinet meeting on Wednesday he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling that Apple must pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in tax to Dublin.	O	O
The Independent Alliance, a group of five lawmakers, has said it wants its senior coalition partners to commit to reviewing how tax is collected from Ireland's large cluster of multinational companies before it considers a challenge.	O	O
Dublin has just over two months to lodge an appeal.	O	O
Any failure of the Alliance to come on board would cast doubt on the government's survival prospects.	O	O
Another independent minister, unaligned to Alliance, also asked to delay a decision when Noonan sought approval on Wednesday.	O	O
Some Irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down a tax windfall equivalent to what it spent last year funding the struggling health service, and the left-wing Sinn Fein party has led attacks from the opposition.	O	O
But others worry a failure to appeal could put in jeopardy the one in 10 jobs provided by multinationals, who are attracted to Ireland by the country's low corporate tax regime.	O	O
Apple has already said it will appeal the ruling, and its chief executive Tim Cook warned on Thursday that if the Dublin government did not join it, this would send the wrong message to business in a country whose economic model depends in part on companies like his.

Apple to shareholders: order to pay back $14.5bn in taxes \u2018will be overturned\u2019

It is not yet clear which side will be backed by either of the 2016 presidential candidates.	O	O
Republican Donald Trump has broken with conservative orthodoxy by saying he would force US companies, Apple in particular, to move manufacturing jobs within the nation’s own borders, rather than allowing them to seek cheaper labor overseas; he has also said he would lower the US corporate tax rate in order to make sure US companies brought their business back to America.	O	O
His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has also hinted that she might lower the corporate tax rate and has said she would move to stop US firms merging with foreign rivals to take advantage of tax loopholes.	O	O
But she also has closer ties to Apple than Trump.	O	O
Apple CEO Tim Cook held a fundraiser for Clinton on 24 August.	O	O
Apple’s Irish tax affairs were first highlighted by a senators Carl Levin and John McCain in 2013.	O	O
The duo then led the Senate subcommittee on investigations.	O	O
Levin, who now serves on the faculty of Wayne State University Law School in Detroit as distinguished legislator in residence, said: “The royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the US should be taxed in the US.	O	O
But Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the US by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland.	O	O
“The IRS [internal revenue service] has failed to stake a claim for US taxes on those revenues for a decade or more.	O	O
It has been passive and so Europe attempts to fill the vacuum.	O	O
Shame on Apple for dodging US taxes.	O	O
Shame on the IRS for failing to challenge Apple’s tax avoidance.”.	O	O

Tim Cook Slams EU-Apple Tax Bill As 'Total Political Crap'
The European Union’s imposition of a 13 billion euro ($14.5 billion) back tax bill on Apple (aapl, -2.47%) is “total political crap,” Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a newspaper interview on Thursday, and anti-U.S. bias may have played a role.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes

'Political crap': Tim Cook condemns Apple tax ruling
The chief executive of Apple has dismissed the EU’s tax ruling as “political crap” and said Ireland was being “picked on”, as he vowed to push ahead with expansion plans in Cork.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
In an interview with the Irish Independent, Tim Cook suggested the European commission might be trying to use state aid rules to harmonise tax rates across the EU.	B	EU
“There are other possibilities too, but I think it’s clear that there is a desire to harmonise tax rates across the EU.	O	O
Doing it this way doesn’t seem like the right approach to me.	O	O
There should be a public discussion about it.	O	O
”He rejected the assertion by European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, who conducted a three-year investigation into the iPhone maker’s complex tax dealings, that Apple paid just 0.005% tax in Ireland in 2014.	O	O

“It’s total political crap,” Cook said.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes

In the year that the commission says we paid that tax figure, we actually paid $400m.	O	O

”        Why Apple is facing a €13bn tax bill in Ireland The Apple boss said he would “love” to see the Irish government appeal against the commission’s ruling to pay €13bn (£11bn) in back tax to the Irish government.	O	O
“I think we’ll work very closely together, as we have the same motivation.	O	O

Further talks are planned before it will make a decision.	O	O
The Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, is one of the strong backers of an appeal, and has insisted that the country needs to preserve its status as a low-tax base for overseas companies.	O	O
Vestager said Apple had improperly routed taxable income to a head office that only existed on paper and could not have generated such profits.	O	O
However, Cook insisted that Apple and Ireland had “played by the rules” and would win the case on appeal.	O	O
He warned this could escalate into a trade row between the EU and US.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
“I think that Apple was targeted here,” he said.	B	Apple

”Cook said Apple paid income tax of 26.1% globally.	O	O
“Some people would say that that should be higher and some might say it should be lower.	O	O
I’d be the first to say that the tax system needs to be reformed and that it should be made simple and straightforward.	O	O
But it should be talked about going forward, not in a way that retrofits the law to what others wish it was.	O	O
”The tech firm is pressing ahead with plans for expansion in Cork.	O	O
Cook said: “We have a 37-year-old marriage with Ireland and it means something to us … I feel like Ireland stuck with Apple when it wasn’t easy to stick with Apple, and now we’re sticking with Ireland.”.	O	O

Ireland: EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
The European Union has said that US tech company Apple must repay a record 13bn euros ($14.5bn) in taxes after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland was illegal state aid.	O	O
"Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years," Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, said on Tuesday.	O	O
Apple's "selective treatment" by the Irish government meant it paid an effective tax rate of only 1 percent on its European profits in 2003, which then fell to a bare 0.005 percent by 2014.	O	O
"The tax treatment in Ireland enabled Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of Apple products in the entire EU single market," Vestager said.	O	O
Brussels launched an inquiry into Apple's tax arrangements in Ireland in 2014, one of a series of anti-trust cases targeting major US corporations that have angered the US administration.	O	O
The European Commission accused Ireland of dodging international tax rules by letting Apple shelter profits worth tens of billions of dollars from tax collectors in return for maintaining jobs.'An exercise in politics'Apple and Ireland rejected the accusation, with Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, calling the ruling "bizarre", and a political exercise by the EU's competition commission.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
"As far as I am concerned there is no economic basis for this decision," Noonan told state broadcaster RTE.	I	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
"It's bizarre and its an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission," he said, according to Reuters news agency.	I	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Noonan also issued a statement saying he disagreed "profoundly with the Commission", and would seek cabinet approval to appeal the ruling.	I	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
"This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation," he said.	O	O
"It is important that we send a strong message that Ireland remains an attractive and stable location of choice for long-term substantive investment.	O	O
"Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement that the "European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
"Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe.	I	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Using the Commission’s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed," Cook wrote.	O	O
For Apple, whose earnings of $18bn last year were the biggest ever reported by a corporation, finding several billion dollars to repay Ireland should not be an insurmountable problem, Reuters reported.	O	O
The 13bn euros represents about 6 percent of the firm's cash pile.	O	O

US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has threatened retaliation if EU orders Apple to pay back tax
US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has threatened retaliation if EU orders Apple to pay back taxThere’s a certain irony in the US criticising the EU for behaving as a “supranational” tax policeman given the way that banks and businessmen have both fallen afoul of the US behaving as a supranational fraud and sanctions cop.I have no sympathy with the majority of those collared by the long arm of the US law as a result of this.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Given the weakness that, say, the UK authorities can sometimes show in the face of white-collar crimes and misdemeanours, the aggressive stance of the US can sometimes be rather useful.	O	O
However, it does mean that the US is throwing stones from a glass house when it levels the same accusation at the EU over tax.	O	O
And just as with the US fraud cops, if the EU is indeed behaving as a suprantional tax watchdog, then more power to it.	B	EU
The background to this is the EU's probe into the Double Irish and the Dutch Sandwich and their various offshoots and derivatives, used by multinationals to shift profits from higher to lower tax jurisdictions within the EU.	O	O
The US is unhappy that most of the companies in the EU’s crosshairs are headquartered in America.	O	O
Apple, Starbucks and Amazon being the most often mentioned, but the Italian headquartered Fiat has been under the cosh as well.	O	O
The Americans are worried that Apple, for example, could get stung with a $19bn (£14.4bn) bill for back taxes as a result of its alleged “sweetheart” deal with Ireland.	O	O
Both parties deny it is anything of the sort, but the EU is unconvinced and you can see why when tax rates of 2 per cent have been bandied around.	O	O
Now if that $19bn figure – calculated by investment bank JPMorgan – is correct and is demanded, the Americans claim that Apple could potentially offset it against its US tax bill.	B	Apple
They characterise this as a vast wealth transfer from Uncle Sam to bad old Brussels.	O	O
They go on to speculate that others could then follow the EU’s lead and have threatened retaliation.	O	O
Is it worth worth noting at this point that presidential and congressional elections are fast approaching and that Democrat Hillary Clinton faces a bellicose nationalist in the form of Donald Trump.	O	O
Going into bat, or should that be stepping up the plate, for great US companies under attack from the whinging big government socialist milksops in Brussels could easily be seen as an attempt by the Democrat administration of President Obama to look every bit as tough as the Donald.	O	O
You don’t need to worry, Main Street, USA, the current Pres is battling for US interests and if the next one is Hillary she’ll do the same	O	O
Meanwhile Apple has upwards of $200bn stashed offshore where the US authorities can’t get their hands on it.	O	O
You see, the US is losing out from Apple’s aggressive approach to tax planning just as much as the EU is.	O	O
Perhaps more so.	O	O
Regardless, the citizens of both jurisdictions suffer when multinational companies avoid paying dues that could be used to build roads, bridges, schools, and so on.	O	O
The truly patriotic approach on the part of both sides would be for them to put their heads together with the aim of finding a way to make multinationals pay because, ultimately, Apple is no more American than Fiat is Italian.	O	O
They and their peers are loyal not to any country or to any trading bloc but to their multinational shareholders and executives.	O	O
They will put their interests before any supposed “national” interests every day of the week and twice on Thursday.	O	O
So you go ahead and wrap yourselves in your flags, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, if that’s what you want to do.	O	O
But after you’ve done that, how about you go out and do the patriotic thing and work together to ensure that both your respective peoples benefit from the tax revenues that are rightfully theirs.	O	O
You know it makes sense.	O	O

The European Commission says Ireland should recover up to \u20ac13bn (£11bn) from Apple in back taxes
The European Commission says Ireland should recover up to €13bn (£11bn) from Apple in back taxesHow should we tax giant technology companies that are able to move money, operations, and often digital goods across borders with increasing ease.	O	O
That is at the heart of today's European ruling.	O	O
The European Commission believes the time has come for radical action to force multinationals to pay more and stop governments competing to offer them special treatment.	O	O
But it faces battles on many fronts.	B	EU
First, against governments such as Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, which face losing the advantages that attract foreign investment.	O	O
They resent what they see as interference in their right to set their own taxes.	O	O
Even the promise of a huge boost to its tax revenues does not seem likely to placate the Irish government.	O	O
Ireland is set to appeal against the commission's decisionThen, of course, there is the might of Apple and its army of lawyers and lobbyists.	O	O
The technology company seems confident that the commission is acting way beyond its own rules in interpreting tax deals - and by the way, Apple denies it got anything that wasn't open to others - as illegal state aid.	B	EU
It has been pointing journalists towards a recent article by a legal expert suggesting that the commission's use of state aid as a tool to drive tax reform "threatens to undermine the rule of law".	B	EU
And then there is the United States government, which last week got its retaliation in first by warning that the EU was trying to become some kind of global tax authority, and was discriminating against American firms.	B	EU
Now, the US would also like Apple to pay more - but only to its own coffers.	B	Apple
Apple chief executive Tim Cook is unwilling to transfer overseas earnings to the US as they would become subject to the country's corporate tax chargeApple's global manufacturing activities and its estimated $215bn (£164bn) cash mountain have become election issues in 2016.	O	O
So, the European Commission faces some formidable opponents and may find itself entangled in litigation and diplomatic disputes for years.	O	O
But it may well believe that it has one powerful lobby behind its campaign - European consumers.	O	O
At a time when globalisation and arrogant multinationals are both going right out of fashion - and governments are still imposing austerity policies - the commission believes that giving Apple a bloody nose will win bravos rather than boos from ordinary people who have to pay their taxes.	O	O

The European Commission’s ruling ordering Apple (AAPL) to repay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) plus interest in unpaid back taxes is the largest tax penalty in a three-year clampdown on advantageous deals given to multinationals by EU nations.	O	O
The EC’s finding that the iPhone maker received illegal tax breaks from Ireland is an attempt to “rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
“In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe.	B	Apple
” Play VideoThe EC found that Ireland had substantially and artificially lowered the tax rate Apple paid in the country for more than two decades, thanks to two tax rulings Ireland issued to Apple starting in 1991 that allowed for a split of Apple Sales International’s profits for tax purposes between its Irish branch and its head office.	O	O
While the Irish branch was subject to the normal Irish corporate tax, the head office -- which exists only on paper, with no workers, premises or actual activities -- wasn’t taxed anywhere, thanks to Irish tax law, which until 2013 allowed for so-called “stateless companies.	O	O
”Only a fraction of Apple Sales International’s profits were attributed to its Irish branch, while the vast majority of profits was attributed to its “head office,” a scenario that meant Apple Sales International paid very little tax on its profits.	O	O
Here’s how it worked in 2011: Apple Sales International made 16 billion euros in profits, but less than 50 million euros were allocated to the Irish branch and the rest to the “head office,” where the profits weren’t taxed.	O	O
That meant Apple’s effective tax rate in 2011 was 0.05 percent.	O	O
For every million euros in profit, it paid just 500 euros in tax.	O	O
That effective tax rate dropped further to as little as 0.005 percent in 2014, which means less than 50 euros in tax for every million euros in profit.	O	O
Apple’s -- and Ireland’s -- practices drew scrutiny in a 2013 U.S.	O	O
Senate subcommittee hearing, at which Michigan Democrat Carl Levin and his colleagues questioned how smaller U.S. companies could possibly compete with a private tax arrangement between Apple and Irish tax authorities in which Apple subsidiaries were subject to a maximum 2 percent rate in Ireland.	O	O
Play Video Tim Cook reaches 5 years as Apple's CEO The EC, it seems, took note of that hearing, and within a matter of weeks was inquiring about Ireland’s practice of issuing tax rulings.	O	O
The EC said Ireland’s arrangement with Apple seemed to constitute a subsidy inconsistent with the principles of fair competition within the EU market.	O	O
It’s not Apple that’s being accused of foul play, it’s Ireland.	O	O
The country was apparently willing to grant a tremendous amount of ground on taxation to gain capital investment, along with potential jobs and economic growth.	O	O

Why the EU says Apple must pay Ireland $14.5 billion in tax
The European Commission (EC) ordered Apple Inc. to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) on Tuesday as it ruled the firm had received illegal state aid.	O	O
What is the EC alleging.	O	O
The European Union’s (EU) executive arm has ruled that Ireland made a deal with Apple that had no basis in tax law.	O	O
The Commission said this involved cutting Apple’s tax bill to almost zero, in return for Apple building factories in Ireland.	O	O
The EC says that is unfair and that Apple must pay Ireland the tax it would have paid if normal tax rules were applied.	B	Apple
Why does the EU care if Ireland does not tax Apple.	O	O
The EU believes sweetheart tax deals help divert investment and jobs away from countries where it would normally go.	O	O
Also, the tens of billions of dollars in profits which Apple enjoys tax free in Ireland each year are generated almost exclusively outside Ireland.	O	O
Hence, Ireland’s deal deprives other EU countries of tax revenue they might otherwise earn.	O	O
Is Ireland about to land a windfall.	O	O
Not anytime soon.	O	O
Ireland’s finance minister said he plans to appeal the ruling in Europe’s highest court.	O	O
That will likely take two years or more and Apple may make legal challenges and is also likely to be able to fight any demands from Ireland’s Revenue Commissioners in Irish courts, tax lawyers say.	B	Apple
Might Apple settle.	O	O
An Apple logo is seen in the window of an authorised apple reseller store in Galway, Ireland August 30, 2016.	O	O
REUTERS/Clodagh KilcoyneIt can certainly afford to, with more than $200 billion in cash or readily marketable securities.	O	O
But since $13 billion is not a major sum for Apple, investors won’t be too worried about the uncertainty it faces and consequently it won’t be under pressure from shareholders to settle.	O	O
The company has been aggressive in defended its tax practices, with CEO Tim Cook testifying to Congress on the issue.	O	O
What does the U.S. government think.	O	O
The U.S. Treasury and lawmakers have criticised the EU approach of using competition law to challenge tax rulings.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
They say the approach is targeting U.S companies, deviates from accepted international practice and threatens U.S. investment in Europe.	I	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
A U.S. Treasury Department White Paper last week said “it continues to consider potential responses should the Commission continue its present course”.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
U.S law allows the President to double taxes on citizens and companies from countries which apply “discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes” on U.S. firms.	O	O
If the EC prevails, does this means that multinationals won’t be able to avoid tax in the EU.	O	O
No.	O	O
The Commission’s case against Ireland was helped by its ability to secure access to documents in which Irish officials were unusually frank about the agreement they made with Apple.	O	O
EU states wanting to secure investment by helping companies avoid tax will in future be more careful about leaving a paper trail which could suggest a tax ruling is a sweetheart deal.	O	O
The EU’s principal legal adviser on tax, Richard Lyal, wrote in a legal journal last year that “It is likely to be only in extreme cases that one can with confidence say that a particular decision reflects a misapplication of the chosen method”.	O	O
Without evidence of an “extreme” deviance from accepted norms, the Commission would likely be reluctant to initiate a tax case.	O	O

Want Apple to pay its taxes? Strengthen US tax laws
The international tax system is only as strong as its weakest link.	O	O
This is the clear message that the European Commission sent on Tuesday when it announced that Apple will have to repay as much as €13bn ($14.5bn) in back taxes due to illegal Irish tax breaks it has received.	O	O
Tax justice advocates across the globe lauded the decision as a big step toward tax fairness.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Unfortunately, an immediate critical response from US lawmakers, coupled with a slick and disingenuous public relations play from Apple CEO Tim Cook, suggests that American taxpayers will probably continue to pay the price for Apple’s tax dodging for some time to come.	O	O
This is a shame, because the commission’s goal of ending tax haven abuse is one in which the United States should, and ultimately must, be a full participant.	O	O
Apple must now pay its taxes.	O	O
This is a vindication of protest | Owen Jones	O	O
The facts of the Apple case are straightforward: with the blessing of the Irish government, Apple created a byzantine network of subsidiaries to shelter its profits in an entity that was a tax resident of no country.	O	O
As a result, billions of dollars of Apple’s income have flowed almost tax free through Ireland’s tax system.	O	O
The European Commission estimates that in 2014, one of Apple’s Irish affiliates paid a tax rate of just 0.005% on its Irish profits.	O	O
The commission ruling sensibly finds that this arrangement violates the EU’s “state aid” rules, giving Apple an unfair competitive advantage, recognizes that Irish taxpayers are potentially not the only victim of Apple’s tax avoidance and makes it clear that prompt action by US lawmakers could ensure that America sees its fair share of Apple’s big tax bill.	B	Apple
But therein lies the rub: while the financial cost of multinational corporations’ offshore tax avoidance has long been clear (US-based Fortune 500 firms have more than $2.4tn parked offshore and are avoiding up to $695bn in US taxes), American lawmakers have demonstrated little appetite for enacting reforms needed to collect tax on this runaway cash.	O	O
A current provision in the US tax law called “deferral” enables allows companies to indefinitely avoid paying even a dime of US tax on offshore profits if they leave them offshore.	O	O
These politicians understand that deferral means the US Treasury is missing a substantial amount of revenue that could be used to fund various public services.	O	O
But for years, Congress and the Obama administration have failed to agree on legislation to compel US corporations to repatriate their offshore cash back to the United States.	O	O
To entice companies to repatriate offshore profits, President Obama has proposed a one-time tax on offshore cash at a reduced rate, and some Republicans have argued for a “tax holiday” that would allow Apple and other firms to repatriate their offshore profits at a rate as low as 5%.	O	O
This rightly has been met with public outcry as it essentially rewards Apple and other offshoring companies with a sharply reduced tax rate on profits that should be taxed fully.	B	Apple
Until US lawmakers agree to strengthen the nation’s tax laws, tax-avoiding companies such as Apple will relentlessly seek out willing governmental partners – like Ireland – to hide their assets.	O	O
And when they find these partners, the tax systems of every other nation in which they do business are the primary victims.	O	O
The series of recent European Commission rulings culminating in this week’s Apple decision have made it clear that European leaders recognize this and are set on stopping Irish and other politicians from subverting the tax systems of other European nations – and the United States.	O	O
If US policymakers don’t take a page from the EU’s book and act promptly, the real victim of Apple’s Irish tax dodge will be American taxpayers.	O	O

Tim Cook on EU tax ruling: 'It is total political crap'
Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook described an EU ruling that it must pay a huge tax bill to Ireland as "total political crap".	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Apple CEO Tim Cook is not mincing words when it comes to his thoughts on the tax battle facing his company.	O	O
"It is total political crap," said Cook in an interview with the Irish Independent when discussing the European Union's ruling on Tuesday that Apple must pay $14.5 billion in what it says are unpaid back taxes.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Apple is under fire over allegations it pays little in taxes in Ireland, a country with a low corporate tax rate (12.5%).	O	O
According to the EU Apple paid just 0.005% on European profits in 2014.	O	O
Cook disagrees.	O	O
"They just picked a number from I don't know where," he said in the interview.	B	EU
"In the year that the Commission says we paid that tax figure, we actually paid $400 million.	O	O
We believe that makes us the highest taxpayer in Ireland that year.	O	O
"Cook says the $400 million was based on Ireland's 12.5% corporate rate.	O	O
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager takes issue with that assessment.	O	O
"This is a decision based on the facts of the case, looking into Apple Sales International, how they are arranged within Ireland, and with the profit recorded there, how they're taxed," she said, according to Irish news site RTE News,Even with the current climate, Cook and Apple have no plan on leaving the country they've been in for 37 years.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Apple currently has 6,000 people working in Ireland and is planning on opening a new facility in Cork.	O	O
The interview with the Irish paper is Cook's latest public comment on the issue.	O	O
In a letter to customers earlier this week, he was just as direct.	O	O
"This claim has no basis in fact or in law,” he wrote.	O	O
“We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals.	O	O
"The fight with the EU comes at a busy time for Apple.	O	O
The company is expected to announce the next version of the iPhone and Apple Watch on Sept. 7 in San Francisco.	O	O
If history is any indication, Cook will likely address the media at that event as well.	O	O
Cook's strident stance with the EU echoes his bare-knuckled fight with the FBI earlier this year.	O	O
When the bureau asked Apple to help it break into an iPhone used by San Bernardino, Calif., shooter Syed Farook, Cook took the matter public in a strongly worded rebuke.	O	O
Eventually, the FBI gleaned information from the phone without Apple's assistance.	O	O
Apple's strategy then, and that of the federal government, at times took on tones of a political campaign, defined as much by press releases and blog posts as legal filings, say analysts.	B	Apple
Cook's insistence that Apple has paid its fair share of taxes in Ireland — and the Irish government angry reply to the ruling — is "sensible rhetorically" as a defense, says Charles King, principal analyst at PundIT Research.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Cook emphatically drove home his point by visiting Ireland, King says.	O	O
As Apple did in its fight with the FBI, it could be leading the way as the unofficial voice of the tech community in its objection to the EU ruling.	O	O
The tax practices of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have, or are likely, to draw the scrutiny of European regulators.	O	O

EU's Vestager warns others, says Apple could cut bill
Other multinationals that do not employ as extreme Irish tax schemes as Apple Inc but shift profits via the country to tax havens could also be breaching EU rules, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.	O	O
European Commissioner for Violation of EU Treaties Margrethe Vestager reacts during a news conference on the approval of the Hutchison-Vimpelcom deal at the European Commission in Brussels, Belgium September 1, 2016.	O	O
REUTERS/Eric VidalShe handed the iPhone maker a record 13-billion-euro bill for Irish registered units that Dublin authorities accepted were liable to tax in no country on Tuesday.	O	O
She told Reuters in an interview that other firms’ arrangements, which involve routing profits to Irish-registered subsidiaries tax resident in places like Bermuda, might fall foul of the Commission on similar grounds.	O	O
“Taxes have been paid nowhere due to the Irish tax code,” she said.	O	O
Asked if the bill would have been different if the head office of Apple’s Irish unit been registered and paid tax in Bermuda, Vestager said: “not much.	O	O
”Vestager said the core of the case against Apple was that it had an Irish registered company that booked most of the profits generated across Europe.	O	O
However, since Ireland didn’t deem the subsidiary tax resident there, the unit was able to report just a small taxable income at an Irish “branch.	O	O
”Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and Washington have denounced the Commission ruling as an unjust raid on tax that should be paid in the United States.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Apple’s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, told reporters on Tuesday that the assertion that Apple doesn’t pay taxes anywhere on much of its profits is “simply wrong.	B	Apple
”“These are profits that are taxed in the United States, and for anybody that understands the U.S. worldwide tax system, this is very easy to understand,” Maestri said.	O	O
“We actually accrue those tax liabilities on our balance sheet on an ongoing basis and we’ve done it consistently over the years.	O	O
”Vestager said if Washington chose to tax the profits reported by Apple’s Irish operation, she would reduce her demand accordingly.	O	O
The United States could do this by forcing Apple to have its Irish units pay more in fees to Apple in California for the right to license Apple patents.	O	O
“If the U.S. tax authority found that the monies paid due to the cost-sharing agreement were too few so that they should pay more in the cost-sharing agreement, that would transfer more money to the States and that may change the books and the accounts in the States,” Vestager said.	O	O
Vestager said, however, that the bill would not be affected if Apple next year moved funds from its Irish units to the United States by paying dividends, even though in this case, the dividends would be taxed.	O	O
She declined to discuss which other companies’ affairs were being looked at by her staff beyond two publicly announced and outstanding investigations into Amazon (AMZN.O) and McDonald’s (MCD.N) in Luxembourg.	O	O
She said that since being alerted to Apple’s methods and other cases by a U.S.	O	O
Senate probe in 2013, the Commission has been looking through about 1,000 such instances in the EU.	O	O
She dismissed accusations from Apple’s Cook and others that her decision was politically motivated or driven by anti-American populism.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
While U.S. companies have been investigated, she said, most of 35 firms probed over tax in Belgium were from Europe, and those still being looked at were a broad sample.	O	O

Apple's $14.6B tax bill explained
Apple's $14.6B tax bill explainedConsider this: In 2014, the corporate giant paid just $50 in tax for every million it made selling iPhones and iPads to most of the world outside America.	O	O
That's a tax rate of just 0.005%.	O	O
Yes, you read that correctly.	O	O
So how was that allowed to happen.	O	O
Apple has funneled most of its profits from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India through Ireland for decades.	O	O
Nothing unusual in that.	O	O
Others do it too.	O	O
But under deals the company struck with the Irish government as far back as 1991, it was allowed to split these profits between its Ireland branch and an Apple head office that existed only on paper.	O	O
Apple paid the standard Irish tax rate on profits booked to its Ireland branch.	O	O
Those it allocated to the phantom head office were tax free, because under Irish law it was then considered a "stateless company.	O	O
"Guess where most of the profits went.	O	O
In 2011, Apple Sales International made 16 billion euros in profits.	O	O
Less than 50 million euros were allocated to the Irish branch.	O	O
The rest went to the "head office," out of reach of any tax authority.	O	O
It was an arrangement that also suited the Irish government.	O	O
Ireland has set its corporate tax rate at 12.5%, one of the lowest in Europe, to attract big companies to the country.	O	O
And with them came the jobs.	O	O
Apple employes 6,000 people in Ireland, many of them making iMacs at a factory in Cork -- once a deprived city in the south of Ireland.	O	O
Apple says it is the biggest private employer in the city.	O	O
EU states can set their own rate of tax.	O	O
But European officials say Ireland's arrangements with Apple gave the company such a huge financial advantage over its competitors that it constituted illegal state aid.	O	O
Apple doesn't want to pay the tax even though the $14.6 billion, plus interest, it might have to repay constitutes just 5% of the $231 billion in cash it has on its books.	O	O
Ireland doesn't like the ruling either, calling it an "encroachment" into its sovereignty.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes

Dubbing the EU's ruling "bizarre", the outspoken Irishman said: "One of the fundamental principles of the European Union is that each country has its autonomy to make its own tax decisions. they shouldn't even appeal the decision - they should just write a letter to Europe and tell them politely to f**k off.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Michael O'Leary has described the EU ruling as "bizarre""The idea that you have the state aid mob - who've had more court verdicts overturned than any other department in Europe in the last 20 years - come along 10 years after the fact and say, 'no we didn't like that, we think you should have done something else', is frankly bizarre.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
"On Tuesday, Europe's antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager slapped the maker of iPads and iPhones with a 13 billion euro (£11.1 billion) tax bill.	O	O
She claimed Apple paid just 1% tax on its European profits in 2003 and 0.005% in 2014, and said its arrangement with the Irish government is illegal under state aid rules.	O	O
Apple is set to challenge the decision, and Mr O'Leary added: "I think there's no chance of this surviving a court ruling in Europe.	B	Apple
There's certain things that Europe has no competence in.	O	O
"Mr O'Leary went on to claim that Ryanair was "one of the most compliant taxpayers in Ireland", having paid a tax rate of about 11.9% on profits last year.	O	O
On Brexit, the chief executive, who backed the Remain campaign during the EU referendum, expects the UK to suffer "significant economic damage" as a result of its decision to quit the single-bloc.	O	O
However, he added that it is too soon to revise the company's financial guidance.	O	O
In July Ryanair said it would "pivot" growth away from UK airports and instead focus on hubs in the European Union following the Brexit referendum result.	O	O
The firm said its growth rate in the UK is expected to slow from about 15% to 6% next year.	O	O
However, with long-term growth in mind, Mr O'Leary is now calling on the UK Government to approve three new runways in a bid to end Britain's airport capacity conundrum for "the next 50 years".	O	O
He urged Theresa May's government to be "radical in its decision making" and rubber-stamp new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports.	O	O
The proposal would mean ending the battle between Gatwick and Heathrow for a new runway.	O	O
"Ryanair calls on the new UK Government to be radical in its decision making on new runways for London instead of picking just one (Heathrow or Gatwick) and calls on Prime Minister Theresa May to approve 3 new runways - one each at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, which will finally resolve the runway capacity issue for the next 50 years, while ensuring competition between airports delivers efficient facilities and prevents airlines and passengers being ripped off by gold-plated monopoly runways," he said.	O	O
Last year, the Government's Airports Commission said a third runway at Heathrow is the best route to expanding airport capacity.	O	O
David Cameron stalled on backing the recommendation, saying the Government required more time to assess the environmental impact.	O	O
A decision is now expected before the end of the year.	O	O
Mr O'Leary said that expanding only one airport would allow airlines to justify raising prices for customers, who might subsequently help foot the bill.	O	O
But competition between three airports would be a boon for travellers and benefit Ryanair long-term, he claimed.	O	O
"We'll have more capacity to grow, fares will fall and in a declining fare environment, we'll win," O'Leary said.	O	O
Mr O'Leary made the announcement as he trumpeted new routes to Strasbourg and Faro and more flights to Sofia and Nuremberg from Stansted, Gatwick and Luton airports.	O	O

Apple has been ordered to pay back billions of euros in back taxes
Apple has been ordered to pay back billions of euros in back taxesIt comes after the EU’s three-year probe into Apple’s Irish tax arrangements.	O	O
How much is Apple worth.	O	O
Just after the EU ruling today, Apple’s stock price was down 2.99 points to $106.82.	O	O
The computer giant is currently listed as having a market cap of $572billion.	O	O
How much will Apple have to pay in back taxes to Ireland.	O	O
The European Commission has ruled that Apple will have to pay up to €13billion (£11billion) in back taxes to Ireland.	O	O
The amount represents taxes that the EU believes Apple should have paid between 2004 and 2014.	O	O
The final figure will be left for Irish Government officials to calculate.	O	O
Apple and the Irish Government are likely to challenge the ruling in the European courts.	O	O
Why is the EU ruling against Apple’s Irish tax deal.	O	O
Apple has paid an extremely low rate of corporation tax thanks to two rulings made by Ireland in 1991 and 2007.	O	O
The “sweetheart” deal means Apple has paid an effective rate of four per cent in corporate tax over the last ten years compared to Ireland’s standard rate of 12.5 per cent.	O	O
The EU’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager said that the tax deal “constitutes state aid” and gave Apple – which employs around 5,500 people in its European headquarters in Ireland – an unfair advantage compared to rival companies.	O	O
The iPhone maker has confirmed it will appeal the rulingMs Vestager said: "Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is illegal under EU state aid rules.	O	O
"The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years.	O	O
"In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014.	O	O
"The sweetheart deal was due to a complicated system where Apple recorded all of its sales in Ireland rather than the countries where products were actually sold.	O	O
This means that around 90 per cent of Apple’s international profits were routed through two Irish entities, which also hold rights to Apple’s intellectual property.	O	O
Apple allocated profits from sales of its products to a “head office” within one of the subsidiaries – Apple Sales International – whichwas not liable for tax in Ireland or anywhere else in the world.	O	O
The EU’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager handed out the mammoth billThe investigation found that the “head office” did not have any premises or employees and consisted solely of board meetings.	O	O
Only a small fraction of sales were routed through Apple Sales’ Irish branch and therefore subject to taxation.	O	O
A second subsidiary – Apple Operations Europe – used a similar arrangement to avoid tax on the majority of its profits.	O	O
The ruling stated that all of Apple’s profits should have been recorded under its Irish branches and therefore should have been liable for tax.	O	O
The vast majority of the €13bilion is unpaid taxes from retail sales channeled through Apple Sales International, with just €50million relating to profits form Apple Operations Europe.	O	O
The amount could change if other countries were to recover taxes from Apple that were routed through Ireland, or if US authorities force the company to pay more money into its US parent.	O	O
The US treasury department blasted EU officials ahead of the ruling, saying it could change the face of US-EU business relations forever.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, is expected to dispute the rulingWhat has Apple said about the tax bill ruling.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Apple released a statement saying that the ruling “has no basis in fact or law” and accused the European Commission of undermining Irelands sovereignty.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
The letter reads: “Over the years, we received guidance from Irish tax authorities on how to comply correctly with Irish tax law — the same kind of guidance available to any company doing business there.	O	O
“In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe.	O	O
“The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
“At its root, the Commission’s case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes.	O	O
It is about which government collects the money.	O	O
”The company confirmed it will be challenging the ruling.	O	O

Apple, Taxes, And The Social Contract Of Global Corporate Citizens
Is Apple avoiding paying its share of taxes.	O	O
And why should I care.	O	O
In light of this week’s news that the EU wants Apple to pay $14 billion in back taxes to Ireland, it is a good time to consider how a company’s tax strategy affects its ability to fulfill its social contract as a global corporate citizen.	O	O
And more broadly, how companies’ tax strategies might impact the ability of the capitalist system to fulfill its potential to create a more shared and durable prosperity for all.	O	O
As a global nonprofit that certifies businesses that meet the highest standards of positive overall social and environmental impact (called B Corporations), B Lab has had to think through this important and complex issue, acknowledging that there are no black-and-white answers.	O	O
We offer up B Lab’s Framework for Evaluating Tax Strategies as a starting point for an important public conversation and an invitation to others to help us further refine our thinking over time.B Lab’s framework reflects both the role that taxes play in contributing to, and the value business receives from, a healthy society.	O	O
In short:The evaluation of a tax strategy should include whether 1) the amount of overall taxes paid over time appropriately reflects the actual amount of income generated by the business; and, 2) the amount of taxes paid over time in each jurisdiction appropriately reflects the actual operations of the business in that jurisdiction.	O	O
Before thinking about how the above framework might apply to Apple’s tax strategies, let’s back up a bit to understand why this issue is so important:Businesses create value for society beyond the taxes they pay.	O	O
Businesses create jobs \u2015 preferably high quality jobs that offer dignity, a living wage and benefits to support a family, and the opportunity to find fulfillment and build assets for long term security.	O	O
Businesses can provide access to basic goods and services as well those that improve our quality of life.	O	O
However, in addition to the many different aspects of value that business provides society, business has an obligation to contribute its share of taxes.	O	O
This is because business exists within the context of society; its proper role is to serve society, not the other way around.	O	O
Moreover, healthy businesses can only exist over the long term in a healthy society.	O	O
A healthy society depends upon public expenditures made possible by taxes.	O	O
These public expenditures benefit business in both direct and indirect ways.	O	O
Examples include things like national defense, local law enforcement and the enforcement of contracts, transportation infrastructure, and education, but also things that more directly bolster economic activity like pensions, health insurance, and other income support.	O	O
This means, in a fractured global tax system that inevitably has its cracks, the bar for a tax strategy that fulfills social obligations should go beyond simply what is legal.	O	O
Just as there are individuals and organizations who believe that outsourcing manufacturing overseas is bad corporate citizenship, there will certainly be those who believe the same thing about any tax management strategy that results in the reduction of corporate taxes through the recognition of revenues in lower tax jurisdictions.	O	O
A thoughtful critic might say that a company could manage its business without routing its revenues through a low tax market, and therefore any reasons for setting up operations in another jurisdiction are just cover for avoiding taxes.	O	O
This critique, from B Lab’s perspective, dismisses legitimate business choices that include the appropriate management of tax burden, but are distinguishable from more questionable tax avoidance schemes pursued by many companies.	O	O
Again, the distinction between tax management and tax avoidance is not always black and white.	O	O
Given these complexities, there ought to be public debate about the appropriate levels of taxation and the sources and uses of tax receipts, as well as regarding effective and responsible tax strategies.	O	O
As a starting place, B Lab determined that certain tax strategies would require additional scrutiny for companies seeking certification as a B Corporation, including:Employing a “corporate inversion” where a company’s legal domicile is moved to a low/no-tax jurisdiction while material operations remain in its higher tax country of origin;Employing a “Double Irish” tax strategy where corporate income can be effectively taxed nowhere;Utilizing a “patent box” or other method to transfer intellectual property to a low/no-tax jurisdiction and licensing back the intellectual property to reduce/eliminate local taxes; orUtilizing multiple shell entities or structures to reduce or minimize taxes The public doesn’t yet know sufficient details of Apple’s tax strategy.	O	O
Whether or not a company is seeking B Corp status, the public interest is served when we ask tough questions and demand thoughtful answers.	O	O
And as details emerge for Apple, it is helpful to have a framework against which we can evaluate those answers.	O	O
And this isn’t just about Apple.	O	O
Many companies employ aggressive tax strategies.	O	O
Asking companies to apply a framework for evaluating tax strategies will help well-intentioned CEOs and CFOs be more thoughtful about balancing the interests of their shareholders with the interests of society, help boards of directors provide better governance, and help all of us make more informed judgements about whether these companies are fulfilling their obligations as corporate citizens.	O	O
Tax avoidance is just one headline-grabbing reason why public trust in business is at an all-time low.	O	O
If we want to rebuild trust in the capitalist system, we can start by giving business the frameworks and tools to demonstrate that they govern themselves to align their interests with those of society.	O	O
If we want to fulfill the promise of capitalism to create a shared and durable prosperity, then indeed it is essential that business leaders set their sights higher than doing what is legal to doing what is responsible and even beneficial to society, not just their shareholders.	O	O
Asking good questions about taxes is one good place to start.	O	O

Apple CEO Tim Cook: $14.5 billion EU tax bill has \u2018no basis in fact or in law\u2019
Tim Cook has rejected the EU’s demand for Apple to return $14.5 billion in ‘unpaid’ taxes in Ireland as having “no basis in fact or law.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
”In a letter to customers, the Apple CEO called the move from the EU “unprecedented” and “harmful.	I	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes

“The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes

We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don’t owe them any more than we’ve already paid,” he added.	I	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
Cook acknowledged that tax laws for companies that do business globally are challenging.	O	O
He argued, however, that by paying its taxes “where the value is created,” Apple has done nothing wrong and it is being unfairly targeted by the EU.	B	Apple
“Nearly all of our research and development takes place in California, so the vast majority of our profits are taxed in the United States.	O	O

Using the Commission’s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed,” Cook said.	O	O
Cook explained that Apple supports international tax reform, but it would rather have that debate with impacted countries and their leaders than with the EU.	O	O
He added that measures should take action going forward, not retroactively as the EU’s directive is.	O	O

European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager gestures during a news conference on Ireland's tax dealings with Apple at the European Commission in Brussels, Belgium on Tuesday.	O	O
The European Union’s antitrust regulators have ordered Apple to cough up about €13 billion (HK$113 billion) in back taxes plus interest to Ireland, after ruling that the Irish government granted illegal tax aid to the US technology giant.	O	O
“Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is illegal under EU state aid rules,” Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, said in a statement on Tuesday.	O	O
Both Apple and the Irish government have said they would appeal that ruling, which followed the EU’s sweeping investigation of member states’ tax ruling practises since June 2013.	O	O
“The Commission’s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years,” Vestager said.	O	O
“In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014.	O	O
”Apple ordered to pay taxes to Ireland.	O	O
Source: European CommissionThe regulators found two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple have substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by the company in the country since 1991.	O	O
The commission said it can order recovery of illegal state aid for a 10-year period preceding its first request for information in 2013, which it estimated at €13 billion plus interest.	O	O
In a statement, Apple said the EU ruling would have “a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe”.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
“We will appeal and we are confident the decision will be overturned,” the company said.	I	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes

”The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the processPaul Haswell, a partner at international law firm Pinsent Masons, told the South China Morning Post that the appeal process will take time and could be “an uphill struggle for Apple”.	O	O
“Bearing in mind that this case will impact tax avoidance approaches taken by many multinational companies operating in or selling to EU countries, it is a fight that Apple has to take on,” Haswell said.	O	O
EU investigators found that taxable profits for Apple’s two Irish-incorporated companies, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, were internally attributed to a “head office”, which existed only on paper.	O	O
Those profits allocated to the head office were not subject to tax in any country under specific provisions of the Irish tax law.	O	O
That treatment enabled Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of Apple products in the entire EU market.	O	O
Citing figures released at US Senate public hearings, the commission said Apple Sales International recorded profits of US$22 billion in 2011.	O	O
“But under the terms of Ireland’s tax ruling only around €50 million were considered taxable in Ireland, leaving €€15.95 billion of profits untaxed,” it said.	O	O
“As a result, Apple Sales International paid less than€€10 million of corporate tax in Ireland in 2011.	O	O
”In October, the commission found Luxembourg and the Netherlands had granted selective tax advantages to Fiat and Starbucks, respectively.	O	O
In January, the commission ruled that Belgium provided tax advantages to least 35 multinational companies.	O	O

Claude Juncker is under the spotlight over his time as Luxembourg PMYesterday Brussels’ Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who prosecuted the Apple case, said she was going after deals apparently signed off by the EU chief next.	O	O
Apple reacted with fury to the judgement handed down earlier this week, indicating it and other large companies will now pull the plug on jobs and investments in Europe.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
McDonald's was one company that allegedly benefit from tax deals under the EU chiefApple boss Tim Cook has reacted with fury to an EU tax decisionAnd Ukip leader Nigel Farage raged: “EU gives Ireland rap on knuckles over state aid, does nothing about what went on in Luxembourg under Mr Juncker.	B	EU
”The spotlight on Luxembourg’s tax history is a huge embarrassment for Mr Juncker, who was prime minister of the country for 19 years before taking up the top position in Brussels in 2013.	O	O
Under his tenure McDonald’s is accused of avoiding a €1billion (£850m) in tax by routing revenue from across Europe through the tiny state, where it is claimed it was given a special deal to lower its tax rate.	O	O
Amazon faces similar claims it lowered its tax bill by making sales to European customers through an arm of the company in Luxembourg.	O	O
In 2014, the online retailer’s UK business paid £11.9million in tax on £5.3billion of sales to British shoppers.	O	O
McDonald’s and Amazon both deny any wrongdoing.	O	O
Juncker has repeatedly claimed any decisions related to the tax arrangements of large companies during his time in office were “strictly a matter for the tax administration”.	O	O
However, the scrutiny of him intensified last month when leaked secret files revealed he met four senior tax officials from Amazon in 2003.	O	O
Bob Comfort, the former head of tax for Amazon, has claimed Mr Juncker fiercely courted the US giant and offered to “help solve problems”.	O	O
He was referring to a meeting with the EU chief in 2003, at which Amazon apparently secured a confidential deal from the local tax office.	O	O
Mr Comfort said: “His message was simply ‘if you encounter problems which you don’t seem to be able to resolve, please come back and tell me.	O	O
I’ll try to help’.	O	O
”Under-fire Juncker is facing calls from across the continent to stand down, not only over his tax dealings but also over his response to the migrant crisis and Brexit.	O	O
The controversial decision against Apple, which has enraged Irish minister who are already planning an appeal, will only add to his woes.	O	O

A decision against Apple and Ireland after a two-year investigation would rebuff US efforts to persuade the commission to drop its interest amid warnings about retaliation from Washington.	O	O
The commission has been investigating whether Apple’s tax deals with Ireland, which have allowed the company to pay very little tax on income earned throughout Europe, amounted to state aid.	O	O
The commission opened a formal inquiry in September 2014 after publishing preliminary findings suggesting deals between Apple and Ireland in 1991 and 2007 involved state aid that was incompatible with the EU’s internal market.	O	O
Apple and Ireland have denied repeatedly that they have a special deal.	O	O
Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has called the investigation “political crap” and said his company and Ireland would appeal against a ruling that Apple received state aid.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
The investment bank JP Morgan has warned that if the commission requires Apple to retroactively pay the Irish corporate tax rate of 12.5% on the pre-tax profits it collected via Ireland it could cost the company as much as $19bn (£15bn).	O	O
Irish sources expect the bill to be much smaller and potentially in the hundreds of millions, the Irish Times said.	O	O
A US Senate investigation in 2013 found Apple paid little or no tax on profits of at least $74bn over four years through gaps in the Irish and American tax code.	O	O

EU antitrust regulators ordered Apple on Tuesday to pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in taxes plus interest to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland was illegal state aid.	B	Apple
The massive sum, 40 times bigger than the previous known demand by the European Commission to a company in such a case, could be reduced, the EU executive said in a statement, if other countries sought more tax themselves from the U.S. tech giant.	O	O
Apple, which with Ireland said it will appeal the decision, paid tax rates on European profits on sales of its iPhone and other devices and services of between just 0.005 percent in 2014 and 1 percent in 2003, the Commission said.	O	O
“Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years,” said Competition Commission Margrethe Vestager, whose crackdown on mainly U.S. multinationals has angered Washington which accuses Brussels of protectionism.	O	O
Online retailer Amazon.com Inc. and hamburger group McDonald’s Corp face probes over taxes in Luxembourg, while coffee chain Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state.	O	O
A bill of 300 million euros this year for Swedish engineer Atlas Copco AB to pay Belgian tax is the current known record.	O	O
Other companies ordered to pay back taxes in Belgium, many of them European, have not disclosed figures.	O	O
For Apple, whose earnings of $18 billion last year were the biggest ever reported by a corporation, finding several billion dollars should not be an insurmountable problem.	O	O
The 13 billion euros represents about 6 percent of the firm’s cash pile.	O	O
As of June, Apple reported it had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $231.5 billion, of which 92.8 percent, or $214.9 billion, were held in foreign subsidiaries.	O	O
It paid $2.67 billion in taxes during its latest quarter at an effective tax rate of 25.5 percent, leaving it with net income of $7.8 billion according to company filings.	O	O
The European Commission in 2014 accused Ireland of dodging international tax rules by letting Apple shelter profits worth tens of billions of dollars from tax collectors in return for maintaining jobs.	O	O
Apple and Ireland rejected the accusation.	B	EU
“I disagree profoundly with the Commission,” Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said in a statement.	B	EU
“The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal.	O	O
“This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation.	O	O
”Ireland also said the disputed tax system used in the Apple case no longer applied and that the decision had no effect on Ireland’s 12.5 percent corporate tax rate or on any other company with operations in the country.	B	Apple
Apple said in a statement it was confident of winning an appeal.	O	O
“The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process.	B	EU
The Commission’s case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes, it’s about which government collects the money.	O	O
It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe.	O	O
”When it opened the Apple investigation in 2014, the Commission told the Irish government that tax rulings it agreed in 1991 and 2007 with the company amounted to state aid and might have broken EU laws.	O	O
The Commission said the rulings were “reverse engineered” to ensure Apple had a minimal Irish bill and that minutes of meetings between Apple representatives and Irish tax officials showed the company’s tax treatment had been “motivated by employment considerations.	B	EU orders Apple to repay $14.5bn in taxes
”Apple employs 5,500, or about a quarter of its Europe-based staff, in the Irish city of Cork, where it is the largest private sector employer.	O	O
It has said it paid Ireland’s 12.5 percent rate on all the income that it generates in the country.	O	O
Ireland’s low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of economic policy for 20 years, drawing investors from multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 workers in Ireland.	O	O
Some opposition Irish lawmakers have urged Dublin to collect whatever tax the Commission orders it to.	O	O
But the main opposition party Fianna Fail, whose support the minority administration relies on to pass laws, said it would support an appeal based on reassurances it had been given by the government.	O	O
The U.S. Treasury Department published a white paper last week that said the EU executive’s tax investigations departed from international taxation norms and would have an outsized impact on U.S. companies.	B	EU
The Commission said it treated all companies equally.	O	O

Apple must now pay its taxes. This is a vindication of protest
Tax avoidance is one of the great injustices of our time.	O	O
Services are cut, justified by the lack of public money available, while mega-rich corporations and individuals find means to avoid paying tax.	O	O
Companies that depend on state largesse – from infrastructure to an education system that trains their employees, to in-work benefits – refuse to contribute in return.	O	O
Small businesses that don’t have the means to exploit loopholes are destroyed by big businesses that do.	O	O
At the bottom of the pecking order, benefit fraudsters are pursued for relatively paltry sums of money, while at the top, accountancy firms help design tax laws and then instruct their clients how to get around them.	O	O
Tax avoidance epitomises an unjust social order: one in which different rules apply, depending on your wealth and power; and where societies are rigged in favour of shamelessly greedy elites.	O	O
Apple ordered to pay up to €13bn after EU rules Ireland broke state aid laws	O	O
That’s why today’s ruling by the European commission – to force Apple to pay up to €13bn (£11bn) in unpaid taxes – is so significant.	O	O
Apple is one of the world’s biggest companies.	O	O
Its arrangement with Ireland allowed it to pay little tax on income earned across the continent: this, the commission says, violates rules on state aid.	O	O
It also represents a defiant rejection of US attempts to defend tax-avoiding corporations.	O	O
Why Apple is facing a €13bn tax bill in Ireland Here is a vindication of protest.	O	O
Tax justice is only on the agenda because movements forced it there.	O	O
It was an issue that once only excited those on the fringes of political debate.	O	O
Years of campaigning changed that.	O	O
Those in a position of authority are responding to pressure from below.	O	O
And here is an instructive lesson.	O	O
Protesting and campaigning can often feel like a lonely, hard and unrewarding slog.	O	O
Social change is often a story of defeat followed by setback, followed by defeat followed by setback – and then success.	O	O
Another striking example: the Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership (TTIP), negotiated between the EU and the US, which would hand corporations the power to sue elected governments in secret courts to block policies that might hurt their profits.	O	O
Years of campaigning and protesting against it across Europe: and it’s paid off.	O	O
On Monday, Germany’s vice-chancellor declared that TTIP had “de facto failed”.	O	O
Today, France’s trade minister called for TTIP talks to be called off.	O	O
People power won.	O	O
We are often told about the futility of protesting and campaigning.	O	O
But these victories tell us otherwise.	O	O
They should embolden us to confront other injustices, too.	O	O
By having a bit of determination and resilience, such injustices can be overcome – and that is a lesson the powerful should fear.	O	O

EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager is leading the probe into Apple's tax affairs
Apple could be ordered to pay billions of euros in back taxes in the Republic of Ireland by European Union competition officials.	O	O
The final ruling, expected on Tuesday, follows a three-year probe into Apple's Irish tax affairs, which the EU has previously identified as illegal.	O	O
The Financial Times reports that the bill will be for billions of euros, making it Europe's biggest tax penalty.	O	O
Apple and the Irish government are likely to appeal against the ruling.	O	O
Under EU law, national tax authorities are not allowed to give tax benefits to selected companies - which the EU would consider to be illegal state aid.	O	O

Apple will barely feel $14.5B hit. Here's why
The European Union ruled that the giant tech company owes Ireland billiions in taxes dating back over two decades.	O	O
USA TODAYApple's (AAPL) tax policy caught up with it Tuesday after the European Union demanded $14.5 billion to be repaid after a decade of lucrative tax breaks in Ireland.	O	O
A blow that big could sink many companies, but it's a drop in the bucket for Apple.	O	O
A tax repayment of $14.5 billion would wipe out the entire year's profits of 487 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500, individually.	O	O
Apple isn't most companies, though, it can easily afford to pay back the money.	O	O
For Apple, the $14.5 billion fine amounts to a mere 6% of its cash and investments of $232.4 billion as of June.	O	O
Apple generates nearly four times more than the size of the tax penalty in free cash flow in just one year, making this $14.5 billion hit a little more than a financial annoyance.	O	O
Apple paid an effective tax rate of 1% on its European profits in 2003 and as little as 0.005% in 2014, according to a report to clients from Credit Suisse to clients co-authored by analyst Kulbinder Garcha.	O	O
Investors wonder what the loss of this lucrative tax shelter will mean for profits going forward, which is the more important consideration at this point.	O	O
"The implications of of this ruling remain unclear and difficult to determine," according to the Credit Suisse report.	O	O
Taxes could suddenly become a more important line item to Apple.	O	O
The company was able to reduce its tax load using a variety of "complex entities" such as Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, Credit Suisse says.	O	O
Credit Suisse estimates that Apple's effective tax rate should have been roughly 5% higher than it was.	O	O
Apple's effective tax rate over the past 12 months has been 25.6%.	O	O
Investors seem to be taking the decision in stride.	O	O
The stock was down less than 1% at $105.92 in early afternoon trading, but closed at $106, down .77%.	O	O
Perhaps they figure Apple can appeal its way out of making the entire repayment.	O	O
"We believe the Apple will not likely pay this entire amount as both Apple and Ireland have stated that they will appeal the ruling," the Credit Suisse report says.	B	Apple

Irish residents opposed to Apple tax ruling
Irish residents opposed to Apple tax rulingIreland is turning its back on a massive tax windfall from Apple.	O	O
The Irish government confirmed Friday it would appeal a European Union order to collect 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes from the tech giant.	O	O
The European Commission ruled Wednesday that Ireland had helped Apple artificially lower its tax bill for more than 20 years, assistance that it said constituted illegal state aid for the company.	O	O
Apple (AAPL) has already said it will appeal.	O	O
CEO Tim Cook has described the Commission's claim that Apple paid Irish tax of just 0.005% on much of its international profits in 2014 as "total political crap.	B	EU
"Irish politicians were divided earlier in the week over whether to pursue an appeal.	O	O
And it's easy to see why.	O	O
As recently as 2010, the country was bailed out by the EU and International Monetary Fund.	O	O
The extra tax billions would go a long way at a time when Irish officials are worried about the impact of Brexit on their economy.	O	O
But multinationals such as Apple have created thousands of jobs in Ireland, and many are worried that the flow of foreign investment could be hurt if the government enforces the EU's retroactive tax demand.	O	O
That feeling is most acute in Cork, the city in the south of Ireland that is home to Apple's European headquarters.	O	O
Residents told CNN this week that investment by multinationals had transformed the regional economy, brought prosperity and jobs and kept it afloat during the recession that followed the global financial crisis.	O	O
"We had two things that saved us: one was Apple, one was our pharmaceutical industry.	O	O
Both very much foreign direct investment," said fishmonger Pat O'Connell.	O	O
Not everyone has sympathy for Apple's case.	B	Apple
Cork politician Donnchadh O Laoghaire supported his party's call not to appeal the tax ruling.	O	O
He said Ireland's special "sweetheart" tax deal with Apple led to a "substantial amount of lost revenue" and the government shouldn't let the issue drag on.	O	O
"In many ways the reputational damage has already been done," he said.	O	O
"I think we need to accept this decision.".	O	O

What a Fed rate hike means for you (get ready to pay more)
Here's how the Federal Reserve's decisions affect your monthly bills.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
BloombergThe Federal Reserve’s decision Wednesday to lift its benchmark short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point is likely to have a domino effect across the economy as it gradually pushes up rates for everything from mortgages and credit card rates to small business loans.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
The Fed forecast slightly faster increases the next few years amid the prospect of a massive government stimulus, signaling three similar hikes next year.	O	O
There are a couple of wild cards in the mix that could have a bigger effect on borrowing costs than the Fed.	O	O
President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to cut taxes and spend up to $1 trillion to upgrade infrastructure, combined with forecasts of rising oil prices, have driven up inflation expectations and long-term bond yields in recent weeks.	O	O
Such factors could play a significant role again next year.	O	O
“Fiscal policy may have a bigger say” than Fed interest rate decisions, says John Canally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial.	O	O
That would mark a shift from prior years, when Fed action had an outsized effect on a slowly growing economy.	O	O
Still, the Fed’s decision to lift the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans, could have at least some effects on consumers:MortgagesThirty-year fixed mortgage rates have climbed above 4% since late October, costing the holder of a $200,000 mortgage about $75 more a month.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
That’s because 10- year Treasury bond yields have jumped about a percentage point since September, partly on Trump’s fiscal stimulus plan and faster inflation forecasts.	O	O
The Fed’s key short-term rate affects mortgages and other long-term rates only indirectly.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
Wednesday’s anticipated hike was priced into such mortgage rates, but three more quarter-point rate bumps next year could lift mortgage rates by a total of an additional 3/8 of a point, says Greg McBride, chief economist of Bankrate.com.	O	O
That would mean an additional $44 a month in payments on that $200,000 mortgage.	O	O
On the margins, that could discourage a small portion of home purchases, says Steve Rick, chief economist of CUNA Mutual Group.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
That effect could be more than offset by a tight labor market and faster-growing economy pushing up average wage gains, allowing homebuyers to easily afford the added cost, Canally says.	O	O
Other factors may loom large.	O	O
If Congress fails to approve Trump’s fiscal stimulus, for example, long-term rates could fall regardless of the Fed, while a faster-growing economy and higher inflation could drive up borrowing costs.	O	O
Adjustable-rate mortgages, by contrast, typically are modified annually and probably would be affected more significantly by four Fed hikes over the next year (including Wednesday’s), McBride says.	O	O
Adjustable rates, he says, could rise about three-quarters of a percentage point in that period, increasing the monthly payment of the $200,000 mortgage by $84.	O	O
Auto loansTypical five-year auto loans will be more directly influenced by a quarter-point increase in the Fed’s key short-term rate, with a 4.25% car loan rate rising by a similar quarter-point, or $3 a month, McBride says.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
Wednesday’s move and three similar rate increases next year would increase the monthly payment for a new $25,000 car by a total $12.	I	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
“Interest rates are going to be a non-issue,” he says.	I	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
Auto sales are likely to moderate after peaking this year, so manufacturers are likely to roll out other incentives, such as lower prices or rebates that temper costs, Canally says.	O	O
Credit cards and home equity lines of creditRevolving loans with variable rates, such as credit cards and home equity lines of credit, will feel the most immediate impact from an increase in the Fed’s key short-term rate.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
Average credit card rates are about 16.25%, while home equity lines are about 4.75%, according to Bankrate.com.	O	O
Banks should pass along quarter-point increases in the federal funds rate to those consumer rates within weeks.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
Bank savings ratesSince banks will be able to charge a bit more for loans, they’ll have a little more leeway to pay higher interest rates on customer deposits.	I	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
Don’t expect a fast or an equivalent rise in your savings accounts or CD rate.	I	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
Since the recession, Americans have kept a big share of their money in banks, so banks don’t have to offer big incentives to draw more deposits so they can lend more, McBride says.	O	O
Low interest rates have spelled narrow profit margins for banks for years.	O	O
They have an opportunity to benefit from a bigger margin between what they pay in interest and what they earn from loans.	O	O
As a result, bank savings and CD rates may rise only after a lag of six months or more after a Fed move, McBride says.	O	O
An increase of a percentage point in the Fed funds rate by late next year may lead to a rise of 30-35 basis points in savings and CD rates.	O	O

US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, the first and only time in 2016, and indicated a faster rate hike pace next year.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
"In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the (Federal Open Market) Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent", said the Fed in a statement after concluding a two-day policy meeting.	I	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
Confidence in economyThe moderate economic expansion, continued strengthening of labor market and the improvement in inflation condition supported the central bank to raise interest rate after nearly a one-year pause, according to the statement.	I	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
"Our decision to raise rates is - certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue and the economy has proven to be remarkably resilient," said Fed chair Janet Yellen at a press conference on Wednesday.	I	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
The US economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the third quarter of this year, higher than the second quarter growth of 1.4 percent, driven by strong consumer spending; the job market continued strengthening and the unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, the lowest level since 2007; and the inflation has increased since earlier this year, with core inflation rate rising to 1.7 percent in October.	O	O
According to economic projections released on Wednesday, Fed officials expected the US economy to grow 1.9 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, both up one percentage point from their September' s forecasts.	O	O
In December last year, the US central bank increased the interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.	O	O
However, a slowdown in global economy since the start of this year and low inflation condition have made Fed policymakers cautious and hold off on any further rate hikes for seven consecutive meetings this year.	O	O
According to Wednesday's statement, Fed officials assessed that "near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced" , but reiterated that they will continue to closely monitor inflation indications and global economic and financial developments.	O	O
Uncertainty clouding future rate path Following the election of Donald Trump as the next US President, US stock market has been hitting record highs on the expectation of Trump's tax policies and infrastructure investment plan.	O	O
All Fed officials "recognize that there is considerable uncertainty about how economic policies may change, and what it might do and how the Fed might have to react," said Yellen in response to Trump' s economic plans.	O	O
She warned that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help the economy get back to full employment, as the unemployment rate has fallen to pre-recession low level, and the degree of slack in the labor market is diminished.	O	O
However, Yellen emphasized that the central bank will factor fiscal policies, along with other things, such as global conditions and oil prices, into economic outlook and figure out appropriate monetary policy.	O	O
According to the economic projections, the central bank forecasts three rate hikes next year, while in its September projections, Fed officials expected only two rate hikes in 2017.	O	O
The slight upward adjustment of forecast reflected Fed officials' consideration of the falling unemployment rate, Yellen said.	O	O
She also mentioned that some officials incorporated some assumption of a change in fiscal policy into their projections.	O	O
But she stressed that "we are operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment and we have time to wait to see what changes occur and to factor those into our decision-making as we attain greater clarity.".	O	O

美國聯邦準備理事會主席葉倫在美國華盛頓於當地時間週三宣布，由於勞動市場改善，美國聯準會將升息一碼。Following the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced at 3am on Thursday, Taiwan time, its decision to increase the target of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points — 0.25 percent — to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent, a move that markets predicted a 100 percent probability of.	O	O
The decision was passed on a unanimous vote.	O	O
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is responsible for interest rate policy decisions, made the decision to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, citing actual and predicted labor market conditions and inflation as reasons for the decision.	O	O
The FOMC statement says that, according to recent information, “the labor market has continued to strengthen, and … economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year,” and that “household spending has been rising moderately but business fixed investment has remained soft.	O	O
”The Fed said that US inflation expectations have increased significantly, and inflation will continue to approach the 2 percent target, with the unemployment rate continuing to fall.	O	O
This is the second time the Fed has increased the rate since last December, this increase coming a year after that move, and the second rate hike in almost 10 years.	O	O
All eyes were on how the Fed officials would view the US’ economic outlook and the speed of interest rate hikes for 2017 in what was the first Fed policy committee meeting since US president-elect Donald Trump’s election victory.	O	O

Photo: BloombergHong Kong saw its borrowing costs in the money market surge to a near eight-year high, with the US Federal Reserve almost certain to raise the interest rate later this week.	O	O
The overwhelming probability that the Federal Open Market Committee will increase the benchmark rate raised market concerns over capital outflows due to the rising allure of US assets.	B	Fed raises key interest rate
The benchmark one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate, or Hibor, surged to 0.624 per cent on Tuesday, the highest level in near eight years, highlighting a squeeze on liquidity conditions in the market.	O	O
With liquidity tightening, or the capital that’s available to be invested in financial markets decreasing, the Hang Seng Index fell 1.4 per cent on Monday.	O	O
The city’s borrowing costs have been rising steadily since the shock victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election last month sent global bond yields skyrocketing.	O	O
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit a high of 2.5 per cent and settled at 2.478 per cent on Monday, the highest close since June 26, 2015, as expectations of higher inflation in the US were further lifted by a recent crude oil price rally.	O	O
Emerging market bonds, in particular, which had benefited from investors’ appetite for yield in the past, have been left reeling by a tidal wave of capital outflows.	O	O
“We are seeing fund flows moving back to developed markets as their bonds are surging,” said Neeraj Seth, the head of Asian Credit at BlackRock’s Asia Pacific Active Investments Group.	O	O
“The trend was already in place ahead of the election results and the US election accelerated it.	O	O
”Driven by surging US Treasury yields, Hong Kong’s 10-year government bond yield jumped 15 basis points to 1.72 per cent, the highest for the benchmark notes of that tenor since January.	O	O
Bond prices move inversely to bonds yields.	O	O
Notably, Hong Kong’s three-month Hibor rose four basis points to 0.87 per cent on Tuesday, leaving its gap with Libor, the benchmark rate that the world’s biggest banks charge each other for short-term loans, at nine basis points, compared to three times that spread just two months ago.	O	O
Higher Hong Kong rates will help to discourage outflows and thus stabilise the local dollar, said Marvin Chen, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase in Hong Kong.	O	O
“Even with two expected US rate hikes next year, the rate gap with Hong Kong won’t be wide enough to spur significant outflows,” said Thomas Shik, acting chief economist at Hang Seng Bank.	O	O

But the real question is not whether they will up the short-term interest rate they control—everyone expects they will, a quarter of a point to 0.5%—but when Janet Yellen & Co. will raise rates again.	B	Fed raises key interest rate
The answer could be sooner than the market thinks, and that could be a problem.	O	O
According to data from Bloomberg, after this week’s expected rate hike, futures traders don’t see another until May.	O	O

The last time that the Fed updated its economic projections, it expected the Fed Funds rate to be around 1.1% by the end of 2017, implying that U.S. central bankers would at most raise rates two times next year.	B	Fed raises key interest rate
The big question for financial markets, and for anyone planning to take out a home loan in the near future, is whether the Fed shifts those projections higher.	O	O
Andrew Sheets, chief global cross-asset strategist with Morgan Stanley, reckons that markets are under-estimating the pace of further policy tightening, possibly because people expect year-end optimism about the economy to fizzle as badly as it did after the Fed’s last hike a year ago.	O	O
But, he says (with fingers firmly crossed), “this time is different.	O	O
” Industry surveys are looking a lot perkier, new jobless claims are lower and, perhaps most importantly, inflation expectations are rising.	O	O
Real, bond yields, i.e. adjusted for expected inflation, are now actually lower than they were a year ago, Sheets said in a research note Sunday.	O	O
That phenomenon is unlikely to last.	O	O
Sheets reckons the Fed will actually raise rates six times between now and the end of 2018.	B	Fed raises key interest rate
By that logic, he says, the dollar is also likely to tend stronger for the foreseeable future.	O	O
Bond markets appear to have taken such messages on board in the last couple of weeks.	O	O
Yields on benchmark 10- and 30-year Treasury bonds have risen by more than half a percentage point since Donald Trump’s election victory, leaving bond investors nursing heavy losses (bond prices and yields move in opposite directions).	O	O
Bond markets opened Monday again with a heavy thud, as a surge in oil prices reinforced expectations of higher inflation.	O	O
The 10-year yield surged to hit 2.5% for the first time in over two years, while the 30-year hit a 17-month high of 3.20%.	O	O

In a widely anticipated and much-delayed move, the US central bank’s policy-setting committee announced that the benchmark interest rate would rise by 25 basis points, boosting federal fund rates to a target range of between 0.5 and 0.75 per cent, up from 0.25 to 0.5 per cent since December 2015.

A Security guard stands in fron oft he US Federal Reserve building, on Aug. 08, 2011 in Washington DC.	O	O
About six months ago, Donald Trump endorsed the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates low.	O	O
“Right now I am for low interest rates, and I think we keep them low,” the then-candidate argued in May.	O	O
As MSNBC’s Benjy Sarlin noted, Trump said the exact opposite in September, arguing that the Fed is part of some kind of conspiracy to help Democrats.	O	O
He added at the time that low interest rates had created a “false economy,” adding that a hike is inevitable “at some point.	O	O
” Trump explicitly accused Janet Yellen, the current Fed chair, of keeping rates “artificially low” to boost President Obama.	O	O
“I think she should be ashamed of herself,” Trump said as part of his bizarre rant.	O	O
In theory, then, Trump should be delighted that the “false economy” and “artificially low” rates are headed in a new direction.	O	O
In a widely expected move, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rates for the first time in a year, citing the “considerable progress the economy has made,” said Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
Fed officials unanimously agreed to raise short-term interest rates by 0.25 percentage points….	O	O
Yellen noted that Americans should prepare for further hikes, saying the committee expected to raise rates “three or more” times in 2017.	O	O
If Trump believed what he said in September, the president-elect should consider this great news.	O	O
Indeed, it’s not just Trump; congressional Republicans in recent years have repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve not to keep interest rates too low.	O	O
And so, in light of yesterday’s announcement, the GOP faces a test: did Trump and his allies mean what they said.	O	O
It’s possible, for example, that Trump was sincere in September, pushing for higher interest rates because he thought it would represent sound monetary policy.	O	O
It’s also possible that he wanted to see a rate hike in the hopes that it would rattle investors and slow economic growth ahead of the election, boosting his own odds of success.	O	O
(As it turns out, we now know it didn’t matter – rates remained low, the economy remained healthy, and Americans elected Trump anyway – but the Republican didn’t know that at the time.	O	O
)Remember, as recently as April, Trump said, “The best thing we have going for us is that interest rates are so low.	O	O
” Soon after, inexplicably, he said the exact opposite.	O	O
So, what’s it going to be.	O	O
The Trump from the spring, who opposed a rate hike because it’d slow the economy, or the Trump from the fall, who demanded a rate hike for reasons he never actually explained.	O	O
The same questions apply to congressional Republicans, by the way, who wanted higher interest rates before the election, but who may suddenly have a change of heart.	O	O
Rep.	O	O
Roger Williams, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, blasted Yellen’s announcement yesterday, insisting it would be “burdensome” on families, adding, “The Fed is effectively making our hardships even harder.	O	O
”Is this the new GOP line.	O	O
Push for higher interest rates when there’s a Democratic president and demand lower interest rates when a Republican takes office.	O	O

He added: "I applaud them for moving in this direction.	O	O

UK interest rates are going nowhere in 2017
Interest rates are going up in the US, but in the UK they are going nowhere.	O	O
That, bluntly, was the message from the Bank of England as it announced its latest decision on borrowing costs less than 24 hours after the US Federal Reserve not only tightened policy but signalled more to come in 2017.	O	O
As far as central banks go, the Fed is an outlier.	O	O
Growth and inflation are both picking up and the US president-elect, Donald Trump, is planning tax cuts and extra spending on infrastructure.	O	O
The normal rule of thumb is that looser fiscal policy should be offset by tighter monetary policy, hence the suggestion there could be three interest-rate rises in the US next year.	O	O

Elsewhere, though, it is a different story.	O	O
The European Central Bank has recently announced an extension of its quantitative easing programme and the Bank of Japan is working overtime to keep deflation at bay.	O	O
The minutes of the latest meeting of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee say the next move in UK interest rates could be either up or down, depending on how the economy evolves over the coming months.	O	O
Threadneedle Street has been pleasantly surprised by how well growth has held up since the EU referendum.	O	O
On its own, that would suggest the MPC should be thinking about following the Fed’s lead and raising rates.	O	O
But the Bank of England suspects that the good news is not going to last.	O	O
It wonders how long consumers will continue to spend so freely once rising inflation starts to affect living standards.	O	O
It thinks the unexpected increase in investment in the third quarter was a flash in the pan.	O	O
If the outlook is for markedly weaker growth in 2017, that would point to further stimulus from the Bank, either through a cut in interest rates to 0.1% or by an extension of its QE programme.	O	O
There are two added complications.	O	O
The first is that the Bank knows inflation is going to breach its 2% target next year but it doesn’t know by how much, or whether rising prices will feed through into higher wage settlements.	O	O
The second unknown is the impact on the economy of triggering article 50 in early 2017, the moment at which formal divorce proceedings start between the UK and the other 27 members of the EU.	O	O
What does all that mean.	O	O
It means interest rates are likely to stay where they are in 2017.	O	O
If they do move, they will move downwards.	O	O

A version of that metric that many experts consider more exact rose only 1.5 percent over that same period.	O	O
That’s still significantly lower than the Fed’s 2-percent inflation target.	O	O
Gagnon said he believes the Fed wants to begin increasing the benchmark rate before the economy reaches the inflation target to ensure the transition is gradual.	B	Fed
“We are coming in for a soft landing, which is what they want,” he said.	I	Fed
“They don’t want to hit the ground too fast.	I	Fed
”Other, mostly progressive, economists argue that the low official unemployment rate masks weakness in the job market that has limited wage growth and in turn kept inflation unexpectedly low.	O	O
Some 6.4 million Americans work part time because they cannot find full-time work, according to an Economic Policy Institute study released this month.	O	O
In a recent blog post arguing against a rate hike, Elise Gould, a labor economist at Economic Policy Institute, noted that pre-inflation wage growth remains significantly lower than it was before the recession.	O	O
“There is good reason to think the U.S. economy is still a ways from maximum employment,” said Andrew Levin, an economist at Dartmouth College and a former senior adviser to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.	O	O
Levin said he is less concerned about an individual rate hike right now than he is about the Fed not clearly communicating the criteria it is using to raise rates over the coming months.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
That is especially concerning because of what Levin considers lackluster economic indicators.	I	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year

JIJIWASHINGTON – The U.S. dollar surged in Tokyo on Thursday to a 10-month high in the upper ¥117 range after the U.S. Federal Reserve suggested a faster pace for rate hikes next year while raising its interest rates for the first time in a year.	O	O
The dollar fetched ¥117.62-63 in Tokyo as of 5 p.m., compared with ¥114.98-115.00 the day before.	O	O
After soaring to the upper ¥117 zone around noon, the dollar lost steam somewhat and retreated to the mid-¥117 range.	O	O
But it made a comeback amid growing speculation that the U.S.-Japan interest rate gap will widen after the Fed said its policymakers expect three rate hikes in 2017, up from two such increases projected in September, dealers said.	O	O
Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks reacted positively to the Fed’s move, with the benchmark Nikkei-225 stock index rising over the ¥19,400 threshold at one point, reaching this year’s highest point.	O	O
It closed the day’s trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange at ¥19,273.79, up 0.1 percent.	O	O
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s action Wednesday in Washington signaled the central bank’s belief that the U.S. economy has improved over the past year after a rough start to 2016 and can withstand slightly higher borrowing rates.	O	O
The central bank said in a statement after its latest policy meeting that it will raise its benchmark rate by a quarter-point to a still-low range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent.	O	O
The Fed last raised the rate in December 2015 from a record low near zero set during the 2008 financial crisis.	O	O
The Fed’s move, only the second rate hike in the past decade, came on a unanimous 10-0 vote.	O	O
The Fed also released an updated economic forecast that showed modest changes to its outlook for economic growth, unemployment and inflation, mainly to take account of a stronger economy and a drop in the unemployment rate for November to a nine-year low of 4.6 percent.	O	O
After the Fed’s announcement, several major banks announced that they were raising their prime lending rate from 3.50 percent to 3.75 percent.	O	O
The prime rate is a benchmark for some types of consumer loans such as home equity loans.	O	O
BB&T and Citigroup were among the banks to announce the increase.	O	O
Mortgage rates have been surging since Donald Trump’s presidential victory last month on expectations that his program of deregulation, tax cuts and increased spending on infrastructure would accelerate economic growth and inflation.	O	O
At a news conference, Yellen said she didn’t think the economy needed stimulus from Trump’s spending plan — the kind of fiscal support that both Yellen and her Fed predecessor, Ben Bernanke, had called for in the past.	O	O
Yellen said such policies would be unlikely to maximize employment, since the unemployment rate is now slightly below the Fed’s own long-term target.	O	O
“I believe my predecessor and I called for fiscal stimulus when the unemployment rate was substantially higher than it is now,” she said.	O	O
The Fed chair stressed that she was not providing advice or guidance to the incoming Trump administration.	O	O
She also downplayed any expectations that Trump’s economic program could lead to faster rate hikes as a result of higher growth and inflation.	O	O

More significant was a fresh batch of Fed policymaker forecasts that indicated the current once-a-year pace of rate increases will accelerate next year.	O	O
With President-elect Donald Trump planning a simultaneous round of tax cuts and increased spending on infrastructure, central bank policymakers shifted their outlook to one of slightly faster growth, lower unemployment and inflation just under the Fed's 2 per cent target.	O	O
The Fed's median outlook for rates rose to three quarter-point increases in 2017 from two as of September.	O	O
That would be followed by another three increases in both 2018 and 2019 before the rate levels off at a long-run "normal" 3.0 per cent.	O	O
That normal level is slightly higher from three months ago, a sign that the Fed feels the economy is still gaining traction.	O	O
The Fed continued to describe that pace as "gradual," keeping policy still slightly loose and supporting some further improvement in the job market.	O	O
It sees unemployment falling to 4.5 per cent next year and remaining at that level, which is considered to be close to full employment.	O	O

All 120 economists in a recent Reuters poll had expected a rate hike at the conclusion of this week's meeting.	O	O
In the weeks following Trump's November 8 victory, Fed policymakers have said his proposals could push the economy into a higher gear in the short run.	O	O
Even though the details of the Republican businessman's plans remain uncertain, the statement marked a rare case in the post-crisis era in which the Fed moved its interest rate outlook higher.	O	O
Risks to the outlook remain "roughly balanced" between factors that could slow or accelerate the economy beyond what the central bank anticipates, the Fed said, no change from the November assessment.	O	O
The rate increase was the first since last December and only the second since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when the Fed cut rates to near zero and deployed other tools such as massive bond purchases to stabilise the economy.	O	O

Australian dollar slumps after US Fed rate hike
The Australian dollar has plunged, falling more than one US cent in overnight trade in the wake of the US Federal Reserve’s move to lift its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of one per cent.	O	O
At 8am (AEDT), the local unit was trading at US74.09 cents, down from US74.89 cents yesterday and sharply lower than its level above US75 cents ahead of the Fed’s announcement at 6am (AEDT).	O	O
The US Federal Reserve lifted its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of one per cent to a range of 0.5 to 0.75 per cent — its first move in a year.	O	O
The Fed also signalled three likely hikes in 2017, up from two previously.	O	O
Westpac senior market strategist Imre Speizer said the indication of three increases was a surprise.	O	O
“The Fed hiked by 25 basis points, which was widely expected, but also raised its interest rate projection which was not expected,” Mr Speizer said in a note.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year

Fed rate hike: What it means for consumers
But, subsequent hikes by the Fed in 2017 could start to really add to the cost of a home.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
Since the day before the election, the cost of a typical San Diego County home increased by $50,400 over the course of a 30-year fixed rate mortgage with 20 percent down.	O	O
Mortgage rates typically track the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury.	O	O
That yield has risen sharply since the election as investors take money out of bonds and put it in the stock market.	O	O
However, the bond market could still change course as investors become less bullish on stocks.	O	O
"The difference of a 0.25 percentage point for somebody looking to borrow $25,000 is $3 a month," he said in a Facebook video.	O	O
"So, nobody is going to have to downsize from the SUV to a compact.	O	O
"Money market accounts, a subset of savings accounts, have historically performed much better.	O	O
The yearly yield was 5.98 percent in 1990, said Bankrate.	O	O
By 2000, it was down to 2.07.	O	O
Today, the average rate on a money market account is 0.11 percent, with the best rates usually coming from credit unions.	O	O
Rates in San Diego County range from 0.01 to 0.05 percent, according to Bankrate.	O	O
Average credit card interest rates are about 16.28 percent, while home equity lines are about 4.78 percent, says Bankrate.	O	O
And banks will pass along that quarter-point increase in the fed funds rate to consumers in a few weeks.	O	O
So, it will make sense to pay this type of debt off before rates get too high or get into some sort of fixed-rate repayment. which indirectly affects mortgage rates — is not likely to make a big difference in the next few months.	O	O

Instead, the US Federal Reserve has made it clear that in 2017 they plan to raise interest rates three times, when just a few months ago it said they would only hike twice in the next 12 months.	O	O
Although rising interest rates are not good for the sharemarket, anyone with debt, or the property market, not every business will suffer from rising rates.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year

Growth stocks are meant to do better as interest rates rise but businesses that are funding their growth with cheap credit will no longer have access to historically low debt.	I	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year

Investors might have to be patient but Nigel Littlewood, who set up Harness Asset Management a few years, thinks one company that will do well now that rates are rising is FSA Group.	O	O
It's not surprising but the business is all about debt, something that is about to get more expensive after years of being very cheap.	O	O
Indeed, over the past two decades, household debt in Australia has grown much quicker than household income.	O	O
Something has to give, eventually.	O	O
A look at how household debt to income has risen shows it's been some growth path.	O	O
From just over 50 per cent in 1990 household debt to income swelled to 125 per cent in 2002, to 177 per cent in 2014 and now, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), it's at a staggering 206 per cent.	O	O
We've also given the credit card a fair workout as more debt is used to pay for all these houses although it's worth noting that net household wealth, taking the debt into account, reached a record $9.06 trillion at the end of September.	O	O
FSA is split into three divisions, services, home loans and small business, but is all about finding debt solutions as well as getting involved in direct lending to individuals and businesses.	O	O
The stock has a market cap of about $160 million but it's the largest holding in Littlewood's boutique fund, that specialises in looking for value in the small and micro cap space.	O	O
He likes the stock for a number of reasons, the most obvious being it's still cheap and will benefit from higher rates.	O	O
But he also thinks that it will be a good investment no matter what rates do.	O	O
The check-list is as follows.	O	O
It trades on a price earnings ratio of 10 times this year's earnings and a dividend yield of about 6.2 per cent that is fully franked.	O	O
For those that can use the franking credits that yield equates to as much as 9 per cent.	O	O
If anyone starts to get into financial distress as these interest rates rise then Littlewood says the services division will grow and "grow faster if interest rates start to surprise on the upside".	O	O
FSA also provides finance to borrowers with a poor track record to buy a car or home.	O	O
"This lending business is growing" says Littlewood.	O	O
"There is also an additional growth product called Easy Bill Pay but it's too early to predict how it will go" he says.	O	O
In addition the management is good and, perhaps just as important, has got a fair bit of skin in the game with a significant stake in the company.	O	O
The balance sheet is strong, they are a market leader in debt services and have a respectable organic growth rate says Littlewood.	O	O
Perpetual is also a substantial holder with a 5.4 per cent stake while Credit Corp Group, Collection House and Pioneer Credit are other stocks in the same space.	O	O

Patrick Commins AFR WoodcutA decision by the US Federal Reserve this week to not raise rates would be "dreadful", as investors and economists consider an increase a foregone conclusion and have now shifted their focus to finding clues on whether the Fed will tighten faster than expected in 2017.	O	O
After lifting rates for the first time in almost a decade this time last year, the Fed has failed to hike further, worried that it could derail what has been a lengthy but frail economic recovery since the global financial crisis of 2008.	O	O
But the market's unexpectedly enthusiastic response to Donald Trump's surprise US election victory on November 8 has removed what was seen as the last possible impediment to a quarter percentage point lift in the official US Fed funds rate to 0.5-0.75 per cent, from 0.25-0.5 per cent.	O	O
Reflecting this, fixed-income traders are pricing in a 100 per cent chance of a rate rise, and the reaction in markets would be one of shock if Thursday morning's decision did not play out as expected.	O	O
"I think it would be dreadful if they didn't [raise rates]," ANZ rates strategist Martin Whetton said.	B	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
"In terms of being a transparent central bank, it would be the wrong message to send.	I	Fed raises key interest rate for first time in year
"With a rate rise locked in, economists are now focused on what they can glean from the Fed's messaging about the path of interest rates into 2017 and beyond, particularly in light of the US President-elect's expected stimulatory agenda of infrastructure spending and tax rate cuts.	O	O
ANZ economists expect a hike in June and December, in line with both the market consensus and the Fed's own median prediction of one or two hikes.	O	O
"I would say most of us in the market believe the risk is they say, 'Hey, we are looking at two, maybe three, hikes next year,' and in that environment you are talking a stronger US dollar and you would definitely see further weakness in the bond market," Mr Whetton said.

The local S&P/ASX 200 Index on futures trading is set to climb 23 points when it opens on Monday morning, putting it close to 5600 points after the benchmark lifted a healthy 2 per cent last week to a four-month high.	O	O
Australian investors have been buoyed by a continuing rally on Wall St - the three main indices hit new peaks on Friday when markets in Japan and Europe also rallied - as well as resilience in prices for crucial commodities such as for iron ore and coal.	O	O
\u200bThe release of key industrial production and fixed asset investment data by China's National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday will be closely watched for any signs of weakness in our major export partner's demand for raw materials.	O	O
Any such indications would also hurt the Australian dollar, which has stayed relatively steady in recent weeks and recently traded around the US74.5¢ mark.	O	O
Local focus on jobs dataWhile the Fed's decision on Thursday will be the focus of global investor attention, the Australian Bureau of Statistics' monthly employment data will be the highlight of the local calendar.	O	O
Economists expect unemployment to remain at 5.6 per cent, and that, monthly ups and downs aside, the trend towards part-time and away from full-time work will continue.	O	O
"From a big, fundamental picture, growth is being driven by the services side of the economy and those are the sectors that are typically part-time employing," the Commonwealth Bank's chief economist, Michael Blythe, said.	O	O
"We are still unwinding bits of manufacturing, like closing car-part factories and so on, so there are full-time jobs going," he said.	O	O
"And it looks like the residential construction boom is getting near a peak, so there's another good source of full-time jobs that will be weaker from here.	O	O

Then Mr Guterres, fluent in Portuguese, English, Spanish and French, turned his attention to the world of international diplomacy, becoming the UN's high commissioner for refugees in 2005.	O	O
Under his guidance, the numbers working in the UNHCR's Geneva head office were slashed, while its capacity to respond to international crises by deploying more staff closer to hotspots was improved.	O	O

General at the UN headquarters in New York, Oct. 13, 2016.	O	O
- The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday appointed Portugal's former Prime Minister Antonio Guterres as next UN secretary-general to succeed retiring Ban Ki-moon whose term expires at the end of this year.	O	O
The 193-member General Assembly adopted a resolution on his appointment by acclamation after Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, Security Council president for October, reported to the Assembly on the council's unanimous recommendation of Guterres.	O	O
The five-year term for the secretary-general designate will start on Jan. 1, 2017 and end on Dec. 31, 2021, according to the resolution.	O	O
Guterres, a 67-year-old politician, served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees from June 2005 to December 2015.	O	O
Before joining the UN refugee agency, Guterres spent more than 20 years in government and public service.	O	O
He was the prime minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002.	O	O
On his appointment, Guterres said he felt gratitude and humility as well as a profound sense of responsibility, while adding that "he is fully aware of the challenges the UN faces and the limitations surrounding the secretary-general.	B	Guterres is appointed as next UN chief
""The dramatic problems of today's complex world can only inspire a humble approach - one in which the Secretary-General alone neither has all the answers, nor seeks to impose his views," said Guterres.	B	UN chief
"One in which the secretary-general makes his good offices available, working as a convener, a mediator, a bridge-builder and an honest broker to help find solutions that benefit everyone involved," he added.	I	UN chief
Guterres expressed his gratefulness to the General Assembly and the Security Council for entrusting him with the position "in a remarkable demonstration of consensus and unity" and for the transparency and openness of the selection process.	B	Guterres is appointed as next UN chief
The incumbent UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said to the Assembly that Guterres not only brings "deep and solid political experience" and has acted as a lifeline for millions upon millions of people forced from homes over the past decade.	B	Guterres

"He is a wonderful choice to steer this Organization as we build on the progress of the past decade while addressing the insecurity and uncertainties of today's world," said Ban.	B	Guterres
Representatives from five regional groups as well as the host country of the UN congratulated Guterres on his appointment and have pledged support for him to guide the UN in face of challenges ahead.	B	Guterres is appointed as next UN chief
On last Thursday, the UN Security Council formally and unanimously recommended Guterres to head the world's largest international organization.	O	O
The UN Charter says "the secretary-general shall be appointed by the General Assembly upon recommendation of the Security Council.	O	O
" In practice, the Security Council will make the final choice and send a single candidate to the General Assembly for approval.	O	O
Traditionally, for a UN secretary-general, each term is five years with a maximum of two terms.	O	O
This year, for the first time in history of the United Nations, UN chief candidates were asked to submit resumes and answer questions from UN member states as well as the civil society during the selection process.	O	O
President of the General Assembly Peter Thomson said at the appointment that guided by principles of transparency and inclusivity, the process that has been undertaken to arrive at today's decision has been a "historic" one.	O	O
"I am confident that Mr. Guterres will serve the global community with dedication, as a moral authority, and be the voice of our collective conscience and humanity, throughout his term," he said.	B	Guterres
According to Thomson, the ceremony at which Guterres takes the oath of office will be held later this year.	O	O

One of the big questions for the Secretary General-designate might well be: can he do a better administrative job in his new role than he did in the past, as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).	B	next UN chief
In that area, Guterres has some history to overcome.	O	O
Midway through his ten-year tenure as UNHCR, in 2010, the U.N.	O	O
’s own book-keepers warned that his agency’s sloppy handling of funds for refugees imperiled future contributions from U.N. member nations.	O	O
Five years later, U.N. auditors were raising much the same flags in another report that faulted Guterres’ office for failing to adequately oversee the handout of nearly a billion dollars to other relief organizations.	O	O
His agency has also been criticized, in a U.N.-sponsored independent evaluation, for engaging in turf wars with other U.N. agencies over how to handle a flood of some 4.6 million refugees from the catastrophic civil war in Syria.	O	O
All of those things, of course, could also be described as relevant experience.	O	O

United Nations: Now it will be 80 years without a woman at the helm
The announcement last week that António Guterres is the next United Nations secretary general marks the ninth male to hold the job since the birth of the UN in 1945, and the fourth from western Europe.	O	O
The usual two five-year terms for the UN’s top office means that it will now be 80 years without a woman secretary general: shame on the UN and the security council.	O	O
António Guterres to be next UN secretary general	O	O
The prospects of finally having a woman to lead the UN engaged and excited the media and thousands of supporters.	O	O
Of the seven female candidates, several would have built on this momentum to regain the legitimacy of the UN in light of human rights, women’s rights and the empowerment of women and girls.	O	O
Over half the world’s population are women and their productivity, intelligence, and insight should be brought into the highest levels of decision making.	O	O
In UN resolution 1325, the security council itself demanded it.	O	O
We wanted a secretary general to provide a powerful moral compass for the UN and we hope the new secretary general will set this as a priority.	B	next UN chief
One of the candidates, Kristalina Georgieva said:“Our problem in the world today is that goodness is quiet; hate is very loud.	O	O
You can hear it everywhere.	O	O
Should I be selected to be secretary general, my job would be to amplify the voice of goodness.	B	UN chief
”    Our problem in the world today is that goodness is quiet; hate is very loud.	O	O
You can hear it everywhere  Kristalina Georgieva   It is sad that her words and those of the other women candidates were never seriously considered.	O	O
Irina Bokova travelled throughout war-torn areas demanding that the destruction of cultural antiquities should be considered a crime against humanity, accountable within the purview of the international criminal court, which resulted in such a case before the court.	O	O
Helen Clark as a former prime minister and head of the UN development programme has the same credentials as Guterres, and she would have been the perfect person to lead on the implementation of the sustainable development goals.	O	O
Former Moldovan foreign minister Natalia Gherman reminded us that youth not only represent the future, young people are part of the present.	O	O
As the youngest of the female candidates at age 47 would have been an inspiration to our younger generation.	O	O
Christiana Figueres demonstrated her multilateral mediation skills by successfully bringing about the agreement on climate change and Susana Malcorra, having spent almost four years as chief of staff to Ban Ki-moon could have hit the ground running.	O	O
Not only did the UN discredit these talented female candidates who lead large international organisations, have been prime ministers, foreign ministers, and high-level EU executives, but Russia turned its back on its own constituency, the east European group.	O	O
Backroom political deals among the old boy’s establishment prevailed once again.	O	O
The general assembly this time around demanded that the process had to be transparent, but that transparency disappeared behind the closed doors of the security council where the decision, according to the UN charter, is ultimately made.	O	O
It is not that António Guterres is a bad choice, but his appointment indicates that the UN is unable to reform and unwilling to accept that women can be strong leaders.	B	Guterres is appointed as next UN chief
It suggests that women are held to a higher standard than men, who simply need to show up.	I	Guterres is appointed as next UN chief
Women need a voice, but that cry went unheard.	O	O
We will hold the new secretary general accountable to his promise to reach gender parity at the highest levels throughout the UN system.	B	next UN chief
Women are suffering around the world.	O	O
The vision of a woman secretary general going from Syria to Chad, Haiti to Bangladesh, talking to these women, hearing their stories, meeting aspiring female leaders and being a symbol of hope, is now lost, slipped away, abandoned by the apparent need for the members of a frequently dysfunctional security council to finally find something to agree on.	O	O
Our campaign to elect a woman UN secretary general gave the international community the opportunity to witness the breadth and depth of the female aspirants.	O	O
And we are proud of them and their tenacity to stand up to the pressures placed upon them, unfair as they have been.	O	O
These talented women, as well as the growing number of highly educated and ambitious female leaders, will continue to contribute their insights as they face the complex challenges ahead.	O	O
We look forward to hearing from them.	O	O

Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General
GeneralThe next Secretary-General of the United Nations has pledged to combat terrorism and political populism, to promote gender equality and to seek a peaceful resolution to the Syrian conflict when he takes over the leadership of the organisation next year.	O	O
Antonio Guterres, the former Socialist Prime Minister of Portugal, was appointed to the role of UN chief on Thursday after a unanimous vote by the international body’s 193 member states.	O	O
In his first address at the UN headquarters in New York, he said he would be a “bridge-builder” and “honest broker” after he officially becomes the world’s top diplomat on 1 January.	B	Guterres
Mr Guterres, 67, spent a decade as the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees and is expected to be a more high-profile figure than the outgoing Secretary-General, South Korean Ban Ki-Moon, who is standing down after two terms.	B	Guterres
Mr Guterres, who was backed by every member of the UN Security Council, was one of 13 candidates for the position, including seven women.	O	O
The first former head of government to be named Secretary-General, he enjoyed a warm reception from the assembled officials following the vote, even as he reminded them of the “challenges” faced by the organisation, and the “limitations” of his position.	O	O
He promised to take a “humble approach” to “the dramatic problems of today’s complex world”.	O	O
His previous role saw him tackling refugee crises across the globe, not least in Syria, which remains the most pressing item on the UN agenda.	O	O
Having previously urged Western powers to take a greater role in helping refugees, he will now press for those governments to find a solution to the suffering of the Syrian people, which, he said, “breaks my heart”.	O	O
Following the precipitous breakdown of a recent ceasefire, the US and Russia are meeting for fresh talks on the Syrian war this weekend in Switzerland, along with regional and European powers.	O	O
“Whatever divisions might exist now it’s more important to unite,” Mr Guterres said.	O	O
“It’s high time to fight for peace.	O	O
”Mr Guterres was congratulated on his appointment by world leaders including US President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.	O	O
Mr Obama said “he had the character, vision and skills needed to lead the United Nations at this critical moment,” while Mr Putin called from the Kremlin to wish him success in his “important and demanding” role.	B	Guterres
In his speech, Mr Guterres also warned of the mutually reinforcing rhetoric of terror groups and of populist political movements – an apparent reference to the European far-right and to the rise of Donald Trump in the US.	O	O
“We must make sure that we are able to break these alliances between all those terrorist groups or violent extremists on one side, and the expression of populism and xenophobia on the other side,” he said.	O	O

(AP Photo/Steven Governo)The 193 United Nations member states of the General Assembly on Thursday elected Portugal's former prime minister Antonio Guterres as the next secretary-general of the U.N.	O	O
Last week the U.N.	O	O
Security Council selected Guterres and recommended him to the General Assembly for endorsement after conducting informal polls.	O	O
Guterres topped all six polls, which included a total of 13 candidates -- seven women and six men.	O	O
Guterres, a 67-year-old socialist politician, was Prime Minister of Portugal from 1995-2002 and the U.N.	O	O
High Commissioner for Refugees from 2005-2015.	O	O
He will be the ninth secretary-general in the organization's 71-year history.	O	O
"I am fully aware of the challenges the U.N. faces and the limitations surrounding the Secretary-General.	B	UN chief
The dramatic problems of today’s complex world can only inspire a humble approach," Guterres responded.	O	O
He will succeed the current secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon of South Korea, who was appointed in 2006 and will leave the post at the end of this year.	O	O
The new secretary-general will assume the role in January 2017 and will serve a five year term, which can be renewed by U.N. member states for an additional five years.	O	O
As FoxNews.com reported, the U.N.	O	O
Office of Internal Oversight Services reported an "unsatisfactory" assessment of UNHCR governance during Guterres’ tenure.	O	O
And in 2011, the U.N.	O	O
’s independent Board of Auditors pointed out "significant concerns about important aspects of UNHCR financial, risk and performance management and the difficulties that the Office is encountering in its attempt to put value for money at the heart of its decision-making and operations.	O	O
" In short, Guterres, though a seasoned diplomat who is quite knowledgeable about the inner runnings of the U.N., will start his new job with a questionable record.	B	Guterres
Assembly President Peter Thompson introduced Thursday's resolution, said members wanted it approved by acclamation, and banged his gavel in approval as diplomats broke into applause.	O	O
Guterres "embodies the highest standards of competence, integrity and leadership," Thompson said.	B	Guterres
Guterres' selection disappointed many who had campaigned for the first woman or the first representative from an Eastern European country to lead the world body, but diplomats stressed they were voting for the best candidate regardless of other criteria.	B	Guterres is appointed as next UN chief
The secretary-general manages a staff of 44,000 people in addition to more than 100,000 peacekeepers.	O	O
The position's responsibilities include dealing with issues such as human rights, refugees and climate change as well as fund raising for the world body's various campaigns.	O	O
Fox News' George Russell, Jonathan Wachtel and The Associated Press contributed to this report.	O	O

The new UN secretary general\u2019s biggest priority must be Syria
Today the United Nations security council has confirmed the former Portuguese prime minister and occasionally outspoken former head of the UN High Commission for Refugees, António Guterres, as the next UN secretary general – a choice that is likely to reaffirmed by the UN general assembly shortly.	O	O
Guterres’ elevation follows what has for the United Nations been the most transparent process of nomination and public debate to date, even if recent weeks have been bedevilled by acrimonious briefing and plotting.	B	Guterres is appointed as next UN chief
This new UN-style glasnost has the advantage of lending Guterres added authority as he prepares to step into Ban Ki-moon’s shoes in December.	O	O
And despite stealing an early march on most of his opponents in a series of straw polls, the emergence of Guterres still comes as something of a surprise.	B	Guterres is appointed as next UN chief
This was supposed to be eastern Europe’s turn; there had been a strong push to have a woman as UN secretary general for the first time; and the ever present threat of a veto from a permanent member might have meant that the strongest candidates would be blocked.	O	O
The optics and choreography of the blessing conferred on Guterres by this month’s president of the security council, Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin, flanked by fellow members, including US ambassador Samantha Power, sends a powerful message.	O	O
Given that he wasn’t its preferred candidate, Russia might have been expected to veto Guterres.	B	Guterres
But faced with the withdrawal of Bulgaria’s support for its and Russia’s favoured candidate, the head of Unesco, Irina Bokova, Churkin knew that the game was up.	O	O
Wartorn Aleppo: ‘As the world’s secular pope, Guterres inherits the charnel house that is Syria.	O	O
’ Photograph: George Ourfalian/AFP/Getty Images The Russians were said to be furious that, under EU pressure, Bulgaria had instead tried to opt for the EU finance commissioner, another Bulgarian, Kristalina Georgieva, despite being unable to do so under the rules.	O	O
But today no one can accuse Russia of saying “nyet” to the most popular candidate for the job, and many now expect that both Russia and China will demand their fair share of senior appointments.	O	O
Indeed there is already speculation that Bokova will become deputy secretary general.	O	O
Without giving any special favours, Guterres will need clear ideas about personnel.	B	Guterres
He will need to improve the efficiency of the organisation while drawing strongly on the ethos and experience of a loyal staff who are able and willing to properly communicate and champion the achievements of the United Nations.	I	Guterres
As the world’s secular pope, Guterres inherits the charnel house that is Syria.	O	O
It will fall to him to take the lead where the security council has so demonstrably failed.	O	O
He has won plaudits for speaking out strongly in the past over a wave of migration from a wartorn Middle East that is now larger than that which took place at the end of the second world war.	O	O
He will need to put Syria at the top of his list of priorities.	B	Guterres
This may call for a more muscular, hands-on approach.	O	O
The UN needs to be right, left and centre of the intense shuttle diplomacy that should have the very best diplomats involved at the highest levels in the capital of every country involved.	B	UN
Building on the happy collusion between the United States and Russia over his selection, Guterres will know that a thawing in relations between these two powers offers the best hope for an eventual peace in Syria, tackling Isis and a series of broader issues – from encouraging nuclear non proliferation to calming tensions on the Korean peninsula – as well as the prospects for wider peace in the Middle East.	O	O
Sustainable development goals: changing the world in 17 steps – interactive	O	O
His predecessor, Ban, has made tackling climate change and the new sustainable development goals very much his signature tune.	O	O
A good deal of the groundwork has been done but, as the world continues to warm, much of the heavy lifting remains.	O	O
Ban often used to say that when he assumed office 10 years ago the biggest conflict in his in-tray was in Darfur, Sudan.	O	O
But in the period since, wars have intensified and become more protracted.	O	O
Women and children, hospitals and aid convoys have become targets with an apparent impunity for those carrying out the heinous deeds.	O	O
The new secretary general will hopefully use his good offices to encourage the security council to give up its power of veto when war crimes are being committed, as they are today in Aleppo and in Yemen.	B	next UN chief
The UN must be able to act decisively and with properly supported peacekeeping operations.	B	UN
The new secretary general will of course be the very model of courtesy and good manners with whomever is elected the next president of the United States, the country that hosts the organisation’s imposing headquarters.	B	next UN chief
He will wine and dine him or her in his marvellous eyrie on the 38th floor of UN headquarters, with its panoramic views of the Chrysler tower and Turtle Bay.	I	next UN chief
But there is little doubt that many in the UN will be privately praying for a female US president, even if they haven’t yet managed a female UN secretary general.	B	next UN chief

"His experience as Portuguese prime minister, his wide knowledge of world affairs, and his lively intellect will serve him well in leading the United Nations in a crucial period," Mr Ban told reporters during a visit to Rome.	I	Guterres

He will need the firm support of the Security Council as well as the wider membership of the United Nations to help him fulfil his mandate in these challenging times."	I	Guterres
For all his ability, Mr Guterres has a huge task ahead.	B	Guterres
He has to find new ways for the UN to handle international crises after its failure to reduce the fighting in Syria.	I	Guterres
He has to reform an unwieldy bureaucracy whose agencies can at times be ineffective and wasteful.	I	Guterres
And he has to make a 20th century organisation relevant in a world where many states and armed groups ignore traditional international rules.	I	Guterres

General Assembly on Thursday officially appointed António Guterres of Portugal as its next secretary-general as he pledged to combat terrorism and extremism while also fighting “xenophobia” and populism.	O	O

“We must make sure that we are able to break these alliances between all those terrorist groups or violent extremists on one side, and the expression of populism and xenophobia on the other side,” he said.	O	O
“We must be able to fight both of them with determination.	O	O
”He added that he would not have all the answers and would not seek to impose his own views.	O	O

High hopes for new U.N. chief
NEW YORK – The General Assembly last week appointed by acclamation Antonio Guterres, former prime minister of Portugal, as the new United Nations secretary-general, replacing the outgoing Ban Ki-moon for a five-year term beginning in January.	O	O
The appointment followed a recommendation from the powerful Security Council, which chose Guterres after six rounds of straw polls conducted since July.	O	O
Guterres received 13 “encourages,” no “discourages” and two “no opinions” at the sixth straw poll held Oct. 5, during which color-coded ballot papers distinguishing five veto-wielding permanent members — China, France, Russia, Britain and the United States — from the 10 elected members of the council were introduced for the first time in this year’s selection process.	O	O
He was confirmed as the council’s choice the next day when a resolution recommending him to the General Assembly as the next U.N. chief was adopted unanimously.	O	O
In addition to his long career in national politics, Guterres is well-versed in the inner workings of the organization, having served as the head of the U.N. refugee agency for 10 years from 2005 to 2015.	B	Guterres
He is also known as a good communicator who is fluent in three of the five U.N. official languages — English, French and Spanish — in addition to his native Portuguese.	I	Guterres
His linguistic skills were a factor that helped his selection since these four languages represent the official languages of nine of the current council members.	I	Guterres
Also behind Guterres’ appointment was this year’s selection process, arguably the most transparent and inclusive in the U.N.	B	Guterres is appointed as next UN chief
’s 71-year history.	O	O
In response to the prevailing criticisms from general U.N. members and civil society that the previous process of choosing the secretary-general had been shrouded in secrecy and that important decisions had been made behind closed doors by the permanent members of the Security Council, this year’s process started with a joint letter from the presidents of the General Assembly and the Security Council inviting all U.N. members to submit the names of candidates with a view to picking the most suitable person for the top U.N. job.	O	O
Mindful of the views advocated by some member states that the next U.N. chief should come from Eastern Europe on the basis of geographical rotation or be a woman following eight male predecessors, the letter specifically encouraged the member states to “consider presenting women, as well as men, as candidates,” while noting “the regional diversity” in previous selections.	B	next UN chief
A total of 13 candidates, including seven women, were nominated, though three later dropped out of the race.	O	O
The candidates were scrutinized by the 193-member General Assembly during a series of public hearings and town hall meeting organized by the General Assembly president from April through July.	O	O
The Security Council also held separate private meetings with the candidates ahead of the six rounds of straw polls that took place from July through October.	O	O
Guterres emerged quickly as the most favorable candidate.	O	O
During the straw polls, he was the only candidate who consistently received “encouragements” from nine or more members, including the five permanent members — a requirement for anyone to be selected as the council’s recommended choice.	O	O
Ambassador Vitaly Churkin of Russia, the council’s rotating presidency for October, said after the sixth straw poll that his country was in a tough spot because Russia favored an East European candidate and wanted a woman candidate, but that in the end, “We chose the best candidate.	B	next UN chief
”While it is welcoming that the next secretary-general has been selected on the basis of merit with the blessing of all U.N. member states, Guterres faces a set of formidable challenges when he assumes office on Jan. 1, including Syria, international terrorism, refugees, North Korea, climate change and U.N. reform, just to name a few.	O	O
The first order of business will be to constitute his own Cabinet in the secretariat, paying due consideration to the competency and gender balance in senior-level posts.	O	O
Following his appointment as the ninth U.N. chief, Guterres told a packed General Assembly Hall that his priorities are to serve the most vulnerable people, particularly refugees and those in conflict zones.	O	O
The plight of socially and economically underprivileged people “makes me feel the acute responsibility to make human dignity the core of my work,” he said.	O	O
As for his role as U.N. chief, Guterres said that the secretary-general should act with humility, without arrogance, and work for the organization’s entire membership as “a convener, a mediator, a bridge-builder and a honest broker.	B	UN chief
” He knows that the power of the office of the secretary-general derives solely from moral authority as the messenger of peace and that support from the 193 U.N. member states is a prerequisite to being successful in dealing with the formidable issues facing him.	I	UN chief
If Guterres sticks to his words and gets the support he needs from member states, there is a good chance that he can be a strong and effective secretary-general capable of restoring the U.N.	B	Guterres
’s credibility as the vanguard of world peace and stability.	O	O

Furniture giant Ikea said Tuesday it was recalling more than 35 million chests and dressers in North America after six children died in the United States when they tipped over.	O	O
The recall by the Swedish company, the world's largest furniture seller, affects 29 million units sold in the United States and 6.6 million units sold in Canada, according to Ikea and safety regulators in the two countries.	O	O
The recalled items are "unstable if they are not properly anchored to the wall, posing a tip-over and entrapment hazard that can result in death or injuries to children," Ikea North America said in a statement.	B	chests and dressers

The empty bureau tumbled down on the dummy in repeated demonstrations.	O	O
Eight million of the recalled items in the United States are Malm model chests and dressers, and 21 million additional children's and adult chests and dressers.	O	O
All were manufactured between 2002 and June 2016.	O	O
In Canada, where no fatal incidents have occurred, the authorities recalled dozens of models sold since 1993.	O	O
Customers in both countries can get full refunds, pick up wall-anchoring kits at nearby stores or have Ikea personnel come to attach wall anchors at no charge.	O	O
Owners were urged to immediately discontinue use of the affected products if not anchored to walls, and to move them to rooms not accessible by children.- Toddlers crushed to death -US victims include a two-year-old boy killed when a six-drawer chest tipped over on him in February 2014, a 23-month-old boy who died when he was trapped under a three-drawer chest in June 2014, and a 22-month-old boy crushed to death by a six-drawer chest in February this year, the CPSC said.	O	O
In the three fatal incidents involving Malm furniture -- made of particleboard or fiberboard -- none of the items were anchored to a wall, the CPSC said.	O	O
Seventeen others were injured in similar incidents.	O	O
Ikea also reported 41 incidents of tip-overs involving non-Malm furniture in the United States, resulting in deaths in 1989, 2002 and 2007.	O	O
Nineteen more children were injured, the CPSC said.	O	O
At company headquarters in Stockholm, Ikea group spokeswoman Kajsa Johansson told AFP that the drawers "meet all mandatory stability requirements on all markets where sold," adding that the bureaus were "safe when anchored to the wall" as instructed.	B	chests and dressers
Ikea has sold more than 147 million chests of drawers over the past 13 years, just over half of them -- 78 million -- of the Malm brand, the company said.	O	O
Prices for the items range between $70 and $200, depending on the model.	O	O
In 2015, Ikea launched a campaign in the United States and Canada to encourage owners of Malm furniture to anchor the pieces to walls.	O	O

But following the death of a 22-month-old child earlier this year, the company is changing direction, admitting it hasn't done enough and is now trying to make things right, reports CBS News correspondent Vinita Nair.	B	IKEA recalls 36 million chests and dressers after six deaths

They also distributed 300,000 anchoring kits designed to secure the dressers to a wall.	O	O
But some consumer experts called that decision a half measure and say the products should have been called back long ago.	O	O

Ikea has issued a recall for at least 29 million chests and dressers that can easily tip over onto children, injuring or killing them, NBC News confirmed.	O	O
The furniture giant said Monday that after the three deaths of three children it is no longer selling its “Malm” series products because they “could be a danger,” Ikea USA president Lars Peterson told NBC News.	B	chests and dressers
“Please take them out of the room,” Peterson said, adding that customers are eligible for a free repair kit to anchor the furniture to a wall.	O	O
Refunds will also be offered.	O	O
The announcement comes after an anchor campaign last year — and amid staggering statistics: every 24 minutes, a child is sent to the emergency room by a falling piece of furniture or a television, according the federal government’s watchdog agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission.	O	O
Every two weeks, a child dies.	O	O
“Children see something they’re trying to get,” commission president, Elliot Kaye, explained to TODAY last year.	O	O
“They start to climb.	O	O
The unit falls over.	O	O
”Among those to be killed by an Ikea Malm dresser was two-year-old Curren Collas.	O	O
Two years ago, the boy's mother, Jackie Collas, went to his room to get him dressed.	O	O
There, she found the dresser on the ground.	O	O
Curren Collas Courtesy of Collas Family"I didn't see him anywhere, so I went over and kind of pulled everything apart," she said.	O	O
"I saw the little top of his head trapped between the dresser" and the bed.	O	O
The dresser, Collas said, was not anchored to the wall.	O	O
"I never heard of that before," she said, adding that one of her "main goals right now is to just spread the word about anchoring anything that could fall.	O	O
"In a statement to NBC News, Ikea said it issued the recall despite the anchor campaign, which resulted in the company sending out 300,000 kits.	O	O
"It is clear that there are still unsecured products in customers’ homes," the statement says.	O	O
"We believe that taking further action is the right thing to do.	O	O
"Alan Feldman, an attorney who represents the families of all three toddlers, said in a statement: “We applaud the CPSC for taking a tough stand in support of consumer product safety by demanding that IKEA take concrete action to get these defective dressers off the market, or at least to make sure that whenever possible, the dressers are secured to a wall.	B	IKEA
It should not have taken repeated injuries and deaths over many years before IKEA finally responded to the potential hazard it placed in millions of American homes.".	I	IKEA

Ikea has recalled the Malm chest of drawers after three children died in North America
Ikea has recalled the Malm chest of drawers after three children died in North AmericaThe recalling is happening in North America, after fatal incidents which occurred in the USA and Canada.	O	O
The Swedish furniture retailer has also stopped selling the drawers in those areas.	O	O
Ikea had warned customers to use wall mounts with the drawers after identifying them as a topple risk but following a third death in February, decided to recall the furniture instead.	O	O
The recall does not apply to the UK and Ireland.	O	O
The units being withdrawn are children's chests of drawers higher than 23.5 inches (60 cm) and adult chests of drawers and dressers above 29.5 inches.	O	O
In addition to the three deaths since 2014, Ikea had received reports of 41 tip-over incidents involving the Malm chests and dressers, resulting in 17 injuries to children between the ages of 19 months and 10 years old, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said.	O	O
Ikea said that anyone who owns one of the pieces of furniture, and has not attached it to a wall, should take it out of the reach of children.	O	O
Consumers can choose between a refund or a free wall-anchoring repair kit.	O	O
The deaths caused by the toppling furniture prompted the CPSC to launch an education campaign to promote awareness of the problem across the industry.	O	O
Ikea said it would help to promote the campaign in the US and around the world.	O	O
The furniture giant said: “With the Secure it campaign, launched globally in stores and on Ikea's website, Ikea urges customers to inspect their chests of drawers and dressers to ensure that they are securely anchored to the wall according to assembly instructions.	O	O
”The chairman of the CPSC Elliot Kaye added: "Today's announcement is not the end of our work on this hazard, nor should it be for the furniture industry.	O	O
The Malm chest of drawers, pictured here, have been recalled in North America"Ikea has several promising ideas to prevent injuries.	O	O
"Over 65 million sets of Malm drawers have been sold worldwide since 2002.	O	O
The drawers come in a selection of sizes and wood veneer finishes, and like most Ikea pieces, are designed to be assembled at home.	O	O
The news about the Ikea Malm chest of drawers comes as a toddler suffered an allergic reaction after his Tesco nappy burst.	O	O

The announcement last week by the Swedish furniture maker Ikea that it was recalling nearly 36 million chests and dressers in the United States and Canada that have been linked to the deaths of at least six children has set off heated discussions among Chinese consumers over being excluded from the deal and the relatively lax safety standards in their own country.	O	O
The recall applies only to North America, where the children were crushed after the furniture tipped over on them.	O	O
Customers who bought the furniture after 2002 are eligible for a partial refund.	O	O
Ikea has said that the chests and dressers are safe when anchored to a wall as instructed with the supplied equipment, but its decision came after pressure from the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission to abide by voluntary industry standards for the stability of free-standing clothing storage units.	B	IKEA recalls 36 million chests and dressers after six deaths
On Weibo, a popular social media platform in China, users complained about the limited scope of the recall.	B	IKEA recalls 36 million chests and dressers after six deaths
“This discriminates against the Chinese people,” a person with the handle HappyLifeEverday wrote.	I	IKEA recalls 36 million chests and dressers after six deaths
A user identified as CHING-ME wrote, “The sooner they close down the better	B	IKEA
Let’s boycott Ikea now	I	IKEA
”China is Ikea’s fastest-growing market, and sales in China last year reached $1.55 billion.	O	O
On weekends, Ikea stores in China are routinely packed with customers, some of whom even nap on the furniture displays.	O	O
But the recall has also prompted widespread calls for more stringent safety standards in the country.	O	O
“This is not discrimination by Ikea,” a user going by the name captain-laomei wrote on Weibo.	O	O
“It’s that our country’s standards are too low — not just for furniture, but for manufacturing, food hygiene, agriculture, health, cars, the service industry, financial services and so on.	O	O
”China has experienced a series of consumer safety scandals, including melamine-tainted baby formula in 2008 that killed six children and sickened 53,000, dangerous levels of heavy metals in rice and ineffective vaccines.	O	O
In recent years, China has begun strengthening automobile safety and manufacturing regulations after numerous automotive recalls.	O	O
“Chinese companies won’t raise their own quality standards, so you end up with two different standards, for inside the country and abroad,” a person identified as My Own Meow wrote on Weibo.	O	O
Ikea has said limiting the recall to North America was justified, since its products meet safety standards in China, the European Union and other markets.	O	O
“The chests and dressers conform to all local regulations and standards,” Xian Jiaxin, a company spokeswoman in Guangzhou, said in an interview.	O	O
Under Chinese standards, children’s furniture that is more than 60 centimeters high, or about 24 inches, must be able to be fastened to a wall and be accompanied by clear directions to do so, although many customers leave them unattached.	O	O
“We emphasize to customers that they must be fastened to a wall,” Ms.	O	O
Xian said.	O	O
She confirmed that the furniture recalled in North America was still sold in all of Ikea’s stores in China.	O	O
Last Thursday, the Shenzhen Consumer Council, a government agency, issued a statement calling for equal consumer protection and further investigations into the safety of the Ikea chests and dressers sold in China.	O	O
“The right to health is the most basic of human rights and should be subject to equal and nondiscriminatory protection in any country and place,” it said.	O	O
“If products publicly recalled in North America are still being sold on the Chinese market, the Ikea Group must unconditionally recall these products.	O	O
”Ikea had not issued a response to the statement as of Tuesday.	O	O
“We are still undergoing internal communications about the council’s statement,” said Mark Peng, a company spokesman in Shenzhen.	O	O
“I fully believe that we will implement an appropriate response after our internal communications are done.”.	O	O

IKEA recalling 36 million dressers, chests blamed for six tip-over deaths
WASHINGTON – Swedish furniture retailer IKEA Group is recalling almost 36 million chests and dressers in the United States and Canada that have been linked to the deaths of six children, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Tuesday.	O	O
The furnishings can topple over if they are not anchored securely to walls, posing a threat to children, the commission said in a statement.	B	chests and dressers
The recall covers six models of MALM chests or dressers manufactured from 2002 to 2016, as well as about 100 other families of chests or dressers, it said.	O	O
“It is simply too dangerous to have the recalled furniture in your home unanchored, especially if you have young children,” CPSC Chairman Elliott Kaye said in a statement.	B	chests and dressers

This was my daughter:"One of those, in July 1989, involved a 20-month-old girl from Mount Vernon, Va., who died after an unanchored Gute four-drawer chest tipped over and pinned her against the footboard of a youth bed, the commission said in a statement.	O	O
"Some of the offhand, inane and insensitive comments in the context of a story about children being injured and dying are abhorrent to me and my wife and hurtful to those reading this article who have also lost children.	O	O
Its funny and cute until it is YOUR child.	O	O
Hard to describe the feeling when you discover your 22 month old suffocated under a dresser.	O	O
We did not know she could climb out of her crib and the wireless room monitor gave no indication of her being out of it.	O	O
Certainly wouldn't be expected to watch her during her nap.	O	O
At that age talking to her about gravity and the dangers of a dresser tipping over on her was not something we even thought about.	O	O
Would she even have understood.	O	O
The dresser tipped when the two top drawers were pulled out; no need to climb or pull on it.	O	O
There were no anchors and nor warnings about tipping in the instructions in 1989 as this was not required.	O	O
Do we feel negligent and guilty.	O	O
Yes and we will forever.	O	O
Should IKEA feel the same way.	O	O
After our daughters death I believe more could have been done beyond bold letters in the assembly instructions, apparently the CPSC agrees, it was a design flaw in 1989 and apparently a persistent one.	O	O
Those of you who believe otherwise are free to do so.	O	O
Please be sensitive to what the story is about.	O	O

""Even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk," Foxx said.	O	O
The ban also means the phones "cannot be shipped as air cargo," according to government regulators.	B	U.S. bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from air travel
That will make Samsung customer trade-ins and refunds difficult.	O	O
Samsung issued a statement Friday saying that it has "encouraged airlines to issue similar communications directly to their passengers.	O	O
"The FAA had previously urged passengers to turn off their Galaxy Note 7 smartphones -- and not charge their batteries -- while on a flight.	O	O
This ban now puts Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on the long list of items banned from flights, such as lighter fluid, electronic cigarettes and hand grenades.	B	U.S. bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from air travel
The FAA's critical move comes four days after Samsung told customers worldwide to turn off their phones -- an unprecedented warning for an extremely popular smartphone.	B	U.S. bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from air travel
Samsung (SSNLF) released the 5.7-inch Galaxy Note 7 device in August as a competitor to Apple's new iPhone 7.	O	O
But customers immediately started complaining that some phones were catching fire.	O	O
The company explained that faulty lithium-ion batteries were overheating the device and causing it to ignite.	O	O
The South Korean electronics manufacturer took several steps to limit the damage from its dangerously glitchy smartphone.	O	O
In early September, Samsung recalled 2.5 million devices worldwide.	O	O
The company offered replacement phones -- but some of those burst into flames too.	O	O
In the past week, Samsung halted production of the device, then announced it was killing off the product line entirely.	O	O
But even those returns are running into problems, because Samsung Note 7s are now banned from FedEx, UPS and USPS planes, and FedEx ground collections are tightly restricted.	O	O
Samsung is attempting to make itself right with customers, so it's offering customers a full refund -- plus a $100 credit for those who buy another Samsung phone.	B	Samsung
The disaster is expected to cost Samsung more than $5 billion.	O	O
The company's stock, which trades in Seoul, has fallen 4% this week.	O	O

A Samsung Galaxy Note 7.	O	O
The U.S. Transportation Department issued an emergency order Friday banning the phones from airplanes.	O	O
A look at the fine print reveals that taking one of the fire-starting smartphones on the plane could land the perpetrator among the ranks of felons.	O	O
Anyone caught with a Galaxy Note 7 on an airplane could face up to 10 years in prison and could be liable for penalties of up to $179,933.	O	O
It's a steep price to pay for an $850 phone.	O	O
While it's unclear whether a future case would be aggressively prosecuted, it's still not worth risking your safety or that of those around you by taking the banned phone on an airplane.	O	O
If you still have a Galaxy Note 7, your best (and safest) bet is to return it where you bought it for a refund.	B	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones
You can also contact Samsung or the retailer that sold it to you to get a prepaid, fireproof box to return the phone by mail.	I	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones

""These on-site reps are there to help customers with last minute travel support and can be located by calling the Galaxy Note7 hotline at 1-844-365-6197," the representative said.	O	O
"But we urge all Galaxy Note7 owners to exchange their device or obtain a refund before they arrive at their airport.	B	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones

An exploded Samsung Galaxy Note 7
)Samsung has suspended production of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, a source said on Monday, after reports of fires in replacement devices added to the tech giant's worst ever recall crisis.	B	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones
Top US and Australian mobile operators also suspended sales or exchanges of Note 7s, while major airlines reiterated bans on passengers using the phones, after smoke from a replacement device forced the evacuation of a passenger plane in the United States last week.	O	O
Fires in phones that were meant to replace devices that had been recalled because of their propensity to explode would be a disaster for the world's largest smartphone maker, suggesting it has failed to fix a problem that has already hurt its brand and threatens to derail a recovery in its mobile business.	B	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones
An exploded Samsung Galaxy Note 7"If the Note 7 is allowed to continue it could lead to the single greatest act of brand self-destruction in the history of modern technology," said Eric Schiffer, brand strategy expert chairman of Reputation Management Consultants.	B	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones
"Samsung needs to take a giant write-down and cast the Note 7 to the engineering hall of shame next to the Ford Pinto.	I	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones
"In a regulatory filing, Samsung said it was "adjusting" shipments of Note 7s to allow for inspections and stronger quality control due to some devices catching fire.	B	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones
It did not comment on the production halt or the cause of the fires, while the source - who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media - did not explain whether specific problems had been identified or when production was halted.	B	Samsung
Samsung told Reuters it was investigating reports of "heat damage issues" and would take immediate action to fix any problems in line with measures approved by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.	B	Samsung
On September 2, Samsung announced a global recall of 2.5 million Note 7s due to faulty batteries which caused some of the phones to catch fire.	O	O
It ordered new batteries from another supplier and started shipping replacements to customers just two weeks later.	O	O
But similar problems arose with a replacement Note 7 on October 5, which began smoking inside a Southwest Airline flight in the United States.	O	O
Samsung shares, which have rebounded after an initial sell-off on the recall, closed down 1.5%, compared with a 0.2% rise for the broader market.	O	O
"I think the cleanest thing to do is to give up on the Note 7," said HDC Asset Management fund manager Park Jung-hoon, whose fund owns Samsung shares.	B	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones
"What's scary is that this is causing people to repeatedly doubt Samsung's fundamental capabilities, so it's important for Samsung to get past this issue quickly.	B	Samsung
"Samsung's recall crisis has coincided with pressure from one of the world's most aggressive hedge funds, Elliott Management, to split the company and pay out $27 billion in a special dividend.	B	Samsung

AT&T, the second biggest mobile operator in the US, said it would stop issuing replacement Note 7s and would let customers with a recalled Note 7 exchange that device for another Samsung smartphone or other smartphone of their choice.	B	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones

Earlier last week, Samsung ended production of the faulty Note 7 smartphone after nearly 100 handsets combusted or overheated, sometimes causing injuries.	O	O

With at least one known incident on-board an aircraft so far and the threat very real, airlines moved swiftly to stop Note 7 devices from overheating or combusting on-board by initially urging travellers to switch off their devices and not to connect them to any power source.	O	O
On Saturday morning, however, HK Express confirmed an immediate ban on the device on all flights, swiftly followed by Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, and Hong Kong Airlines.	B	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Air travelers went about their business Monday, not too freaked out that the federal government is now treating Samsung Galaxy Note7 smartphones sort of like bombs.	O	O
Amid reports that the smartphone’s batteries catch fire, the U.S. Department of Transportation last week banned the devices from air transportation in the U.S. 	B	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones
To some travelers, the ban was both unsettling and somewhat confusing.	B	U.S. bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from air travel
If the phones really pose such a threat, some wondered, why are the federal government and the airlines relying on an honor code to enforce the ban.	O	O
“They really downplayed it,” said Mary Martin, 44, who teaches art history at Johnson State College in Vermont.	B	U.S. bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from air travel
Martin said she first heard about the ban on her flight to Washington, where she was working over the weekend as a judge at an art fair.	O	O
But Martin said that as far as she knew, the only high-voltage presence onboard was former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in the row ahead of her.	O	O
Martin admitted that she was a little bit concerned that one of the contraband phones would still end up aboard a flight and perhaps catch fire.	B	Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones
“I’m not so worried about someone being malevolent,” she said, as she made her way through Reagan National Airport to board a flight back home.	O	O
“I’m think my concern is a totally exhausted traveler – it doesn’t register with them.	O	O
”https://twitter.com/Creative_Rants/status/785665788392927232https://twitter.com/EntirelyAmelia/status/787736889851871232On Friday, the U.S.	O	O
DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency ban on that type of smartphone after reports that their batteries could ignite and burn.	O	O
Earlier this month, the battery of a supposedly safe replacement for the Galaxy 7 smartphone caught fire aboard a Southwest flight headed from Louisville to Baltimore.	O	O
But TSA agents are not rooting around in people’s luggage the way they do for liquids or weapons.	O	O
The DOT is relying on self-enforcement.	O	O
“If, in the course of their normal duties, they encounter one at the checkpoint, they will inform the owner that the phone is not allowed on the aircraft and direct the passenger to leave the checkpoint and come back without the phone,” a TSA spokeswoman said in an email.	O	O
The TSA is not confiscating them, either.	O	O
If they’re found in checked baggage, they’re turning the phones over to the airlines.	O	O
John Wells, 47, an engineer from Olney, Md., who owns an older Samsung smartphone, said he chalked up the episode to the ever-accelerating push by engineers to satisfy a public that wants smaller, smarter longer-lasting electronic devices in their lives.	O	O
But there just wasn’t enough testing, he said while heading into the airport to catch a flight.	O	O
Marty Zoltick, 54, a patent attorney who was returning to Washington after a trip to South America, said he thought the ban made sense, although he was also a little puzzled by the mixed message from the government.	B	U.S. bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from air travel
“It’s all honor system,” he said.	O	O
His wife, Debbie Zoltick, 53, who is self-employed, said she imagined a lot of people would ignore the ban the way they ignore other safety directives concerning their phones.	B	U.S. bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from air travel
“Half the people don’t turn off their cellphones,” she said.	O	O
But she also wasn’t too worried one would catch fire aboard her flight.	O	O
